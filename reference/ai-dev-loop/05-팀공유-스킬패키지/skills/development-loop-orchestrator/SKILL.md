# Development Loop Orchestrator

## Purpose

Determine the current development-loop stage and route to the next required skill. This is not a background hook or automatic scheduler. It is a control skill for agent-led sessions.

## Stages

```text
0. Bootstrap
1. Feature docs
2. Planning gate
3. Implementation
4. Validation
5. Evidence report
6. Handoff / next session
```

## Required Sub-Skills

Use these skills as needed:

- `project-bootstrap` for Stage 0
- `feature-docs-scaffold` for Stage 1
- `planning-gate` for Stage 2
- `validator-loop` for Stage 4
- `evidence-report` for Stage 5

## Stage Detection

Use targeted reads first. Do not run broad full-tree scans such as `rg --files` over the whole repository when the project has large `reference/`, archive, prototype, generated, or vendor folders. If file discovery is necessary, restrict it to the loop surface first:

```text
.
docs/
docs/sessions/
.agents/skills/
.claude/skills/
reference/README.md
reference/acc-analysis/
```

Read large reference trees only after a selected feature needs a specific source file. This keeps the orchestrator focused on stage detection instead of wasting context on unrelated reference material.

Read available files:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `SPEC.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `CHECKS.md`
- `EVIDENCE.md`
- `HUMAN_GATE.md`
- `docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md`
- `docs/PRD.md`
- `docs/TRD.md`
- `docs/UI_Spec.md`
- `docs/Data_Model.md`
- `docs/Task_List.md`
- `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`
- `docs/Test_Scenarios.md`

Then decide:

| Condition | Stage | Next action |
|---|---:|---|
| Project instructions or loop files missing | 0 | Run `project-bootstrap` |
| Feature selected but 7 core docs missing | 1 | Run `feature-docs-scaffold` |
| Docs exist but cross-links not verified | 2 | Run `planning-gate` |
| Gate result is `FAIL` | 1 or 2 | Fix docs; do not implement |
| Gate result is `SLICE-ONLY PASS` | 2 | Confirm boundary before implementation |
| Gate result is full `PASS` or user accepts slice boundary | 3 | Implementation may start |
| Implementation changed files but checks not recorded | 4 | Run `validator-loop` |
| Verification evidence exists but no closeout | 5 | Run `evidence-report` |
| Closeout exists and next session is updated | 6 | Stop or ask for next feature |

## Rules

- Do not treat `SLICE-ONLY PASS` as a full document-loop pass.
- Do not start implementation if human approval gates are triggered.
- Do not skip validation because the change is small.
- Do not describe hook automation as complete unless hook scripts/config exist and were tested.
- Keep the next action to one stage. Do not bundle implementation and validation in the same instruction unless the user explicitly asks and the gate permits it.

## Output

Use this format:

```text
Development Loop Stage:
Current evidence:
Blocking items:
Recommended next skill:
Exact next prompt:
Can implementation start: yes/no/slice-only
Hook automation status:
```

## Hook Automation Status

Report one of:

- `none`: no hook or watcher exists
- `designed-only`: docs describe hook behavior but no executable exists
- `scripted`: hook/watcher script exists but not verified
- `verified`: hook/watcher script exists and has evidence in `EVIDENCE.md`

Default to `none` unless evidence proves otherwise.
