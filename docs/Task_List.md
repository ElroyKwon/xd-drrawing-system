## 2D Sheet Viewer First Slice Tasks

Planning gate PASS recorded 2026-06-18. Implementation may start when the user requests it. Local-only viewer shell/static sheet render only — real viewer engine, TypeDB integration, customer drawings, and deployment remain out of scope for this slice.

## DWG/DXF Upload Conversion Management Tasks

These tasks define the fifth planning slice. They are not implementation authorization. DUC must pass a formal planning gate before any product code or conversion adapter work starts.

| T-DUC-003 | FR-DUC-003 | Planning Candidate | Define DWG to DXF conversion job status, timestamps, converter identity, input/output counts, and messages. | AC-DUC-003; TS-DUC-003 |

| T-DUC-005 | FR-DUC-005 | Planning Candidate | Define sheet/viewable candidate rules that do not depend on populated paperspace layouts. | AC-DUC-005; TS-DUC-005 |
| T-DUC-006 | FR-DUC-006 | Planning Candidate | Define separate render-risk state so conversion/scanning success is not treated as viewer-quality PASS. | AC-DUC-006; TS-DUC-006 |
| T-DUC-007 | FR-DUC-007 | Planning Candidate | Define future relation from converted artifacts to Build `Sheet` rows and ACC #11 viewer entry points. | AC-DUC-007; TS-DUC-007 |
| T-DUC-008 | FR-DUC-008 | Planning Candidate | Define future issue, memo, and markup overlay slots without persisted records. | AC-DUC-008; TS-DUC-008 |
