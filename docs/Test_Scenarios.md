# Test Scenarios

No app exists yet, so these scenarios define the checks to run after implementation is approved and completed.

| Test ID | Requirement ID | Acceptance ID | Scenario | Expected result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TS-IS-001 | FR-IS-001 | AC-IS-001 | Open the project list screen. | Required ACC #6 list structure and columns are visible. |
| TS-IS-002 | FR-IS-002 | AC-IS-002 | Search by `Study_Project`, search by a project number, then clear search. | Matching rows filter correctly and full list returns after clear. |
| TS-IS-003 | FR-IS-003 | AC-IS-003 | Click `+ 프로젝트 만들기`. | Centered `프로젝트 작성` modal opens over the project list. |
| TS-IS-004 | FR-IS-004 | AC-IS-004 | Inspect modal fields and defaults. | All ACC #1 fields and select/date affordances are present. |
| TS-IS-005 | FR-IS-005 | AC-IS-005 | Submit the modal with an empty project name. | Required validation appears, modal stays open, list count is unchanged. |
| TS-IS-006 | FR-IS-006 | AC-IS-006 | Enter a valid project name and submit. | One local mock project is added, modal closes, new row is searchable by name/number when number is provided. |
| TS-IS-007 | FR-IS-007 | AC-IS-007 | Reopen modal, enter partial data, click `취소`; repeat with close button. | Modal closes and list count remains unchanged for both actions. |
| TS-IS-008 | FR-IS-008 | AC-IS-008 | Run desktop and mobile viewport checks through create, validation, cancel, close, and search flows. | No overlap, clipping, broken modal layout, or console errors. |
| TS-IS-009 | FR-IS-009 | AC-IS-009 | Review dependencies and runtime requirements. | No auth, DB, API, Autodesk account, paid SDK, customer drawing, or deployment is required. |

## Automated Checks

- Future app package tests should cover search filtering, required-name validation, successful create append, and cancel/close no-change behavior.
- Do not claim `npm test`, `npm run build`, or browser automation as passing until an app package exists.

## Manual Browser Checks

- Compare UI against:
  - `reference/acc-screenshots/ScreenShot Tool -20260612102152.png`
  - `reference/acc-screenshots/Video Screen1781231401038.png`
- Check desktop width.
- Check mobile width.
- Check Korean label/button fit.
- Check browser console during open, validation, create, cancel, close, and search flows.

## Console Checks

- Browser console must show no errors for covered interactions.
- Network failures are not expected because this slice has no backend or external API.
