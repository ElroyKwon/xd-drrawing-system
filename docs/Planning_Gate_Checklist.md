# Planning Gate Checklist

## Document Existence

- [x] `docs/PRD.md`
- [x] `docs/TRD.md`
- [x] `docs/UI_Spec.md`
- [x] `docs/Data_Model.md`
- [x] `docs/Task_List.md`
- [x] `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`
- [x] `docs/Test_Scenarios.md`
- [x] `docs/Design_Map.md`
- [x] `docs/User_Flow.md`

## Cross Checks

- [x] Every PRD feature maps to at least one task in `docs/Task_List.md`.
- [x] Every PRD feature maps to at least one acceptance criterion in `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`.
- [x] Every PRD feature maps to at least one test scenario in `docs/Test_Scenarios.md`.
- [x] Visible UI actions map to user-flow steps in `docs/User_Flow.md`.
- [x] Visible UI fields/actions are represented in `docs/UI_Spec.md`.
- [x] Data model supports required create/read behavior and explicitly excludes update/delete/undo for this slice.
- [x] Human approval gates are documented through `HUMAN_GATE.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/TRD.md`, and `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`.

## Pre-Implementation Boundary Check

- [x] The planning-gate pass itself made no app scaffold changes.
- [x] The planning-gate pass itself made no `npm install` or dependency changes.
- [x] The planning-gate pass itself made no UI implementation changes.
- [x] No DB/API/Auth/Autodesk integration.
- [x] No paid SDK.
- [x] No customer drawing data.
- [x] No deployment.

## Post-Gate Implementation Status

- [x] Initial setup slice was implemented after PASS using Vite + React + TypeScript + Vitest.
- [x] Implementation remains local mock state only.
- [x] `npm test` and `npm run build` passing evidence is recorded in `EVIDENCE.md`.
- [x] Desktop/mobile browser evidence is recorded under `docs/evidence/`.

## Gate Status

- Result: PASS on 2026-06-15.
- Reason: seven core docs exist, UI support docs exist, FR-to-task/acceptance/test mappings are complete, UI actions map to user-flow steps, and risky external integration items remain out of scope.
- Evidence: recorded in `EVIDENCE.md`.

### 2D Sheet Viewer Gate Status

- Result: PASS on 2026-06-18 formal planning gate.

- Implementation eligibility: the local-only viewer shell/static sheet render slice may proceed to a scoped implementation request with owned files and TDD checks. This PASS does not authorize real viewer engine or external integration work.
- Human gate: real viewer engine evaluation/adoption, customer drawings, Autodesk-backed processing, paid SDK, DB/API/TypeDB/schema integration, CAD editor behavior, and deployment remain unapproved.

### DUC Gate Status

- Result: DOCS READY / FORMAL GATE NEEDED NEXT SESSION.
- Current result: document scaffold is complete for the DUC planning slice, but product implementation must not start until a next-session planning-gate pass explicitly reviews these DUC changes.
- Implementation eligibility: none yet for DUC product code.
- Human gate: real Autodesk/APS use, ODA/paid SDK product adoption, customer drawings, production storage, DB/API/TypeDB/schema integration, auth/RBAC, CAD editor behavior, and deployment remain unapproved.
