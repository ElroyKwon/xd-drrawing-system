# Planning Gate Checklist

## Document Existence

- [x] `docs/PRD.md`
- [x] `docs/TRD.md`
- [x] `docs/UI_Spec.md`
- [x] `docs/Data_Model.md`
- [x] `docs/Task_List.md`
- [x] `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`
- [x] `docs/Test_Scenarios.md`
- [x] `docs/Design_Map.md`
- [x] `docs/User_Flow.md`

## Cross Checks

- [x] Every PRD feature maps to at least one task in `docs/Task_List.md`.
- [x] Every PRD feature maps to at least one acceptance criterion in `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`.
- [x] Every PRD feature maps to at least one test scenario in `docs/Test_Scenarios.md`.
- [x] Visible UI actions map to user-flow steps in `docs/User_Flow.md`.
- [x] Visible UI fields/actions are represented in `docs/UI_Spec.md`.
- [x] Data model supports required create/read behavior and explicitly excludes update/delete/undo for this slice.
- [x] Human approval gates are documented through `HUMAN_GATE.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/TRD.md`, and `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`.

## Boundary Check

- [x] No app scaffold.
- [x] No `npm install`.
- [x] No UI implementation.
- [x] No DB/API/Auth/Autodesk integration.
- [x] No paid SDK.
- [x] No customer drawing data.
- [x] No deployment.

## Gate Status

- Result: PASS on 2026-06-15.
- Reason: seven core docs exist, UI support docs exist, FR-to-task/acceptance/test mappings are complete, UI actions map to user-flow steps, and risky external integration items remain out of scope.
- Evidence: recorded in `EVIDENCE.md`.
