# TRD

## Technical Approach

초기 설정 slice는 planning gate PASS 이후 Vite + React + TypeScript + Vitest baseline으로 구현됐다. 현재 구현은 클라이언트 로컬 상태와 mock 프로젝트 데이터만 사용해 ACC #6 `프로젝트 목록`과 ACC #1 `프로젝트 작성 모달`의 UI/상호작용을 검증한다.

## Frontend Boundary

- 허브 레벨 프로젝트 목록 화면을 현재 app의 첫 진입 화면으로 둔다.
- 프로젝트 목록 데이터는 초기 mock 배열에서 읽는다.
- `+ 프로젝트 만들기`는 같은 화면 위에 modal state를 열고 닫는다.
- form state는 클라이언트 내부 상태로 유지한다.
- submit 시 프로젝트 이름 validation을 먼저 수행한다.
- 유효한 submit은 mock 배열에 1건 append한다.
- 검색은 클라이언트에서 프로젝트 이름과 번호를 대상으로 수행한다.
- 필터, 컬럼/설정, 페이지네이션은 ACC #6 레이아웃 affordance로 먼저 제공하고, 실제 고급 설정 기능은 후속 slice로 미룬다.

## Backend Boundary

- 이 slice에는 backend가 없다.
- REST API, database persistence, authentication, authorization, Autodesk account 연결은 만들지 않는다.
- 서버 상태, tenant model, role-permission model은 후속 설계/승인 전까지 다루지 않는다.

## Persistence Model

- Persistence: 없음.
- Runtime state: 브라우저 세션 내 local mock state.
- Reload behavior: 구현 시 새로고침하면 기본 mock 목록으로 돌아가는 것이 허용된다.
- Customer data: 사용하지 않는다.

## External Dependencies

- 현재 app baseline은 `package.json`의 Vite, React, TypeScript, Vitest, Testing Library 의존성을 사용한다.
- 후속 구현 단계에서 paid SDK, Autodesk API, customer drawing 사용이 필요한 경우 `HUMAN_GATE.md` 기준으로 먼저 확인한다.
- 저장된 screenshot/reference 문서는 읽기 전용 근거로만 사용한다.

## Explicit Non-Use

- No Autodesk cloud/API integration.
- No Autodesk account login.
- No paid SDK.
- No database schema.
- No production API.
- No auth/permission model.
- No deployment.
- No customer/confidential drawings.
- No CAD editor or DWG editing behavior.

## Requirement Mapping

| Requirement ID | Technical handling |
|---|---|
| FR-IS-001 | Render project list from local mock projects. |
| FR-IS-002 | Filter local mock projects by lowercase name/number match. |
| FR-IS-003 | Toggle modal visibility from create CTA. |
| FR-IS-004 | Maintain modal form state for listed fields. |
| FR-IS-005 | Block submit and show field-level validation when name is empty. |
| FR-IS-006 | Append one mock `Project` and close modal on valid submit. |
| FR-IS-007 | Close modal without state mutation on cancel/close. |
| FR-IS-008 | Validate layout manually in desktop/mobile browser and check console. |
| FR-IS-009 | Keep all data and integration boundaries local-only. |

## Project Admin Member Access Technical Addendum

The Project Admin member-access slice remains frontend-only and uses local mock state. It does not introduce routing libraries, backend persistence, authentication, authorization, database schema, Autodesk cloud/API, paid SDK, deployment, or customer drawing data.

### Data Types

```text
Project
- id
- name

Member
- id
- name
- email
- phone

ProjectMemberAccess
- projectId
- memberId
- role
- status
- addedAt
```

Derived UI rows join `ProjectMemberAccess` to `Member` by `memberId`. Duplicate access is blocked when the same `projectId` and `memberId` already exist.

### Frontend Handling

- `src/projectAdminData.ts` will own types, mock records, constants, and helper functions.
- `src/ProjectAdminView.tsx` will own local state, table filtering, row selection, inspector display, add modal state, and validation messages.
- `src/App.tsx` will expose a small local entry path from `Study_Project` to Project Admin without adding a router.
- Company information is excluded; if a non-selected `회사` navigation label appears for Project Admin context, it must not expose company fields or management behavior.

### Project Admin Requirement Mapping

| Requirement ID | Technical handling |
|---|---|
| FR-PA-001 | Render `ProjectAdminView` for `Study_Project` from local app state. |
| FR-PA-002 | Build rows by joining `ProjectMemberAccess` to `Member` and filtering by selected project. |
| FR-PA-003 | Filter derived rows by lowercase member name/email match. |
| FR-PA-004 | Store selected `memberId` and render details in the right inspector. |
| FR-PA-005 | Toggle add-existing-member modal visibility from `구성원 추가`. |
| FR-PA-006 | Block submit and show `구성원을 선택하세요.` when no member is selected. |
| FR-PA-007 | Block duplicate project/member submit and show `이미 이 프로젝트에 추가된 구성원입니다.` |
| FR-PA-008 | Append one local `ProjectMemberAccess` row with selected role and close the modal. |
| FR-PA-009 | Keep `Project`, `Member`, and `ProjectMemberAccess` separate and avoid company/auth/DB/API scope. |

## Build Shell And Sheets List Technical Addendum

The Build shell and sheets list slice remains frontend-only and uses local mock sheet metadata. It does not introduce a router, backend persistence, authentication, authorization, database schema, Autodesk cloud/API, paid SDK, deployment, customer drawing data, upload/publish flow, or 2D viewer engine.

### Data Types

```text
Sheet
- id
- projectId
- number
- title
- version
- versionSet
- disciplineCode
- disciplineLabel
- tag
- lastUpdatedBy
```

### Frontend Handling

- `src/buildSheetsData.ts` owns sheet types, mock rows, and filtering helpers.
- `src/BuildSheetsView.tsx` owns the Build shell, selected `시트` navigation state, sheet table, search query, and list/grid view toggle affordance.
- `src/App.tsx` exposes a local entry path from `Study_Project` to Build sheets without adding a routing library.
- Grid view is an affordance in this slice. The functional, tested view is the ACC #10 table/list.

### Build Shell Requirement Mapping

| Requirement ID | Technical handling |
|---|---|
| FR-BS-001 | Render `BuildSheetsView` for `Study_Project` from local app state. |
| FR-BS-002 | Render fixed Build header and left rail; set `시트` as selected. |
| FR-BS-003 | Render local `Sheet[]` rows filtered by selected project. |
| FR-BS-004 | Display sheet metadata fields directly from mock rows. |
| FR-BS-005 | Filter rows by lowercase number/title/discipline/tag match. |
| FR-BS-006 | Store selected view mode locally and expose list/grid toggle affordance. |
| FR-BS-007 | Render inert local affordances for export, filter, row menu, and pagination. |
| FR-BS-008 | Exclude viewer/upload/storage/compare/markup/issues from code paths. |
| FR-BS-009 | Keep external integrations and persistence out of scope. |

## 2D Sheet Viewer First Slice Technical Addendum

The first viewer slice is a document-loop kickoff for a future frontend-only implementation. It should use local mock sheet metadata and static sheet render UI. It must not add a real viewer engine, dependency installation, drawing parser, backend persistence, authentication, authorization, database schema, TypeDB integration, Autodesk cloud/API, paid SDK, deployment, or customer drawing data.

### Data Types

```text
SheetViewerState
- projectId
- sheetId
- selectedTool
- zoomLevel
- panelTab: "markup" | "issues"
- equipmentEntityIdSlot: string | null
```

### Frontend Handling

- A future `SheetViewerView` can be opened from a selected local `Sheet` row.
- The central drawing surface is a static local render or placeholder, not a parsed drawing file.
- Toolbar buttons, bottom controls, and panel tabs are local UI state only.
- Markup, issue, compare, measurement, and fullscreen controls may be visible affordances but must not persist data or require an engine.
- `equipmentEntityIdSlot` reserves the future XD ontology binding point without TypeDB, DB/API, or schema work.

### Human-Gated Alternatives

- Real viewer engine evaluation/adoption is a separate gated decision.
- PDF.js, OpenSeadragon, APS Viewer, ODA, Autodesk-backed processing, paid SDKs, customer drawing ingestion, and DB/API/TypeDB integration require approval before implementation.

### 2D Sheet Viewer Requirement Mapping

| Requirement ID | Technical handling |
|---|---|
| FR-SV-001 | Open a future local `SheetViewerView` from selected mock sheet state. |
| FR-SV-002 | Read selected `Sheet` metadata for title/context labels. |
| FR-SV-003 | Render a static local sheet surface with no drawing file loading. |
| FR-SV-004 | Store selected viewer tool as local UI state. |
| FR-SV-005 | Store zoom/fit control affordance state locally. |
| FR-SV-006 | Store left panel tab state and render empty markup/issues panels. |
| FR-SV-007 | Reuse local mock sheet list for navigation context. |
| FR-SV-008 | Reserve `equipmentEntityIdSlot` only; no ontology integration. |
| FR-SV-009 | Keep all real viewer, persistence, external integration, customer drawing, and deployment work out of scope. |

## DWG/DXF Upload Conversion Management Technical Addendum

The DUC slice is a planning and feasibility bridge, not product implementation. It defines how future work can move from local DWG samples to conversion/scanning artifacts and eventually into a viewer workflow. It must not be merged into the ACC #11 local-only viewer shell implementation.

### Local Experiment Baseline

Observed local tooling:

```text
ODA File Converter:
  C:\Program Files\ODA\ODAFileConverter 27.1.0\ODAFileConverter.exe
Python:
  3.12.9
Python packages:
  ezdxf: available
  fitz: available
```

Observed local conversion pipeline:

```text
Reference DWG sample
-> copy to repo-outside temp upload-staging
-> include xref folder or nearby XR*.dwg when available
-> ODA File Converter DWG to ACAD2018 DXF
-> ezdxf readfile
-> scan layouts, layers, blocks, modelspace entity types, INSERT names, text samples
-> record conversion and scan summary
```

### Future Technical Shape

```text
DrawingSourceFile
-> DrawingIntakeValidation
-> DrawingConversionJob
-> DrawingConversionArtifact
-> DxfScanSummary
-> DrawingViewableCandidate
-> Future viewer surface
-> Future issue/memo/markup overlays
```

### Official APS Benchmark

Autodesk Platform Services Simple Viewer shows the cloud reference architecture as Authentication, Data Management, Model Derivative, and Viewer. In that tutorial, server endpoints list models, check translation status, and upload a model before starting translation. Model Derivative translates designs to Viewer-compatible derivatives such as SVF2 and extracts metadata. The Viewer SDK is a JavaScript library for viewing 2D/3D design models in websites and supports customization/extensions.

This project does not call APS in the DUC planning slice. APS remains a benchmark and future HUMAN_GATE item.

### Chrome DevTools Research Boundary

Autodesk's own APS blog demonstrates that Chrome DevTools Network inspection can help debug BIM360/Forma Viewer scenarios by observing token/refresh calls and loading a model in a minimal viewer test page. For this project:

- DevTools/Network analysis can help understand request order, viewer asset loading, model URN flow, and translation status polling.
- Tokens, cookies, account IDs, and proprietary payloads must not be committed or copied into project docs.
- This route requires legitimate account/session access and is a research aid, not a product dependency.

### DUC Requirement Mapping

| Requirement ID | Technical handling |
|---|---|
| FR-DUC-001 | Model a local intake queue using copied reference samples or later mock file metadata. |
| FR-DUC-002 | Validate file extension, source discipline, size, xref/package availability, and conversion eligibility. |
| FR-DUC-003 | Represent conversion as a job with status, timestamps, converter adapter, input/output counts, and messages. |
| FR-DUC-004 | Scan DXF using structured APIs such as `ezdxf`, not ad hoc string parsing. |
| FR-DUC-005 | Derive sheet/viewable candidates from layouts, modelspace extents, title text, and block/INSERT evidence; do not rely on paperspace alone. |
| FR-DUC-006 | Track render readiness separately from conversion/scanning readiness. |
| FR-DUC-007 | Map artifacts to future `Sheet` rows and viewer entry points without changing current ACC #11 scope. |
| FR-DUC-008 | Keep issue/memo/markup overlay design as future UI/data slots only. |
| FR-DUC-009 | Record APS architecture references while keeping credentials/API calls gated. |
| FR-DUC-010 | Propose JSON traceability/progress output as a future loop artifact, separate from current production data models. |
