## ACC To XD Adaptation

- ACC visual hierarchy is the benchmark; XD naming and product context can replace Autodesk brand details during implementation.
- Autodesk cross-sell products shown in ACC screenshots are not functional requirements for this slice.
- `Build` as default access may remain as a benchmark label in mock data until XD module naming is decided.
- Template selection is represented only as a modal field; template management remains out of scope.
- Company references in Project Admin are treated as excluded context only; company details and company management are not implemented in the ProjectMemberAccess slice.
- ACC Build shell and sheets list are reproduced as local UI and metadata only; real drawing files, viewer engines, upload/publish, and Autodesk-backed processing are excluded until a later approved slice.
- ACC 2D viewer is reproduced first as a local static viewer shell. The first slice reserves room for markup, issues, measurement, compare, and ontology binding but does not implement those workflows or adopt a real viewer engine.
- DUC uses Autodesk Cloud-like upload/translate/viewer architecture as a functional benchmark, not as an automatic APS implementation decision.
- Chrome DevTools/Network analysis may inform how web viewer assets, token flows, URNs, and model status calls are structured, but tokens/account payloads must not be saved or committed.
