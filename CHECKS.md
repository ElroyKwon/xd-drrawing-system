# Project Checks

## Setup Checks

```powershell
Test-Path -LiteralPath "D:\_Project\xd-drawing-system"
Test-Path -LiteralPath "D:\_Project\xd-drawing-system\reference\acc-screenshots\_ACC-Build-화면분석-재현설계.md"
Test-Path -LiteralPath "D:\_Project\xd-drawing-system\reference\dks-design-docs\도면관리시스템_상세설계\00_개요-PMO\README.md"
Test-Path -LiteralPath "D:\_Project\xd-drawing-system\.agents\skills\project-bootstrap\SKILL.md"
Get-ChildItem -File -LiteralPath "D:\_Project\xd-drawing-system\reference\acc-screenshots" | Measure-Object
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File -LiteralPath "D:\_Project\xd-drawing-system\reference\dks-design-docs\도면관리시스템_상세설계" | Measure-Object
```

## Current App Checks

Run these before claiming the current app baseline is passing.

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm run dev -- --port 5173
```

## AI Loop Hook Checks

Run this before claiming the test-scope `.ai-loop` hook scaffold is present.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
```

Dry-run the first queued review request without launching a worker:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once -DryRun
```

Mode dispatch dry-runs should cover each supported mode before claiming the runner supports mode dispatch:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once -DryRun
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once -DryRun
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once -DryRun
```

Prepare one queued request per mode before running those dry-runs:

- `review-only`
- `validation-evidence`
- `implementation`

For normal code changes after dependencies are installed, at minimum run:

```powershell
npm test
npm run build
```

## Manual Checks For UI Work

- Compare implemented screen against the matching files in `reference/acc-screenshots/`.
- Check that button text and labels fit on desktop and mobile widths.
- Check browser console errors.
- Record screenshot evidence when a UI slice is implemented.

## Manual Checks For Initial Setup Slice

Reference screenshots:

- `reference/acc-screenshots/ScreenShot Tool -20260612102152.png`
- `reference/acc-screenshots/Video Screen1781231401038.png`

Pass/fail checks:

- Project list screen shows the ACC #6 structure: hub header, `프로젝트` tab, `+ 프로젝트 만들기`, project table, search box, filter affordance, column/settings affordance, and pagination.
- Project table includes at least these columns: 유형, 이름, 번호, 기본 액세스, 허브, 작성 날짜.
- Search filters mock projects by project name or project number and can return to the full list when cleared.
- `+ 프로젝트 만들기` opens a centered `프로젝트 작성` modal over the project list.
- Modal contains the ACC #1 fields: 프로젝트 이름, 프로젝트 번호, 프로젝트 유형, 템플릿, 주소, 시간대, 시작일, 종료일, 프로젝트 값, 통화.
- Submitting with an empty 프로젝트 이름 shows a required-field validation state and does not add a project.
- Submitting with a valid 프로젝트 이름 adds one local mock project row and closes the modal.
- `취소` and close dismiss the modal without adding a project.
- No external Autodesk account, API, paid SDK, database, customer drawing, or deployment action is required.
- Browser console has no errors during open, validation, create, cancel, search, and close flows.
- Desktop and mobile widths do not show overlapping text, clipped button labels, or broken modal layout.

## Manual Checks For Project Admin Member Access

Reference screenshots:

- `reference/acc-screenshots/ScreenShot Tool -20260612102437.png`
- `reference/acc-screenshots/Video Screen1781227558018.png`

Pass/fail checks:

- Project list exposes a local path to open Project Admin for `Study_Project`.
- Project Admin shows `Study_Project` context and `구성원` selected in the left rail.
- Member table shows only current `Study_Project` access rows before adding a new member.
- Search filters by member name and email and clears back to all current access rows.
- Selecting a row updates the right inspector.
- `구성원 추가` modal opens.
- Empty add submit shows `구성원을 선택하세요.`
- Duplicate access submit shows `이미 이 프로젝트에 추가된 구성원입니다.`
- Valid existing member + role submit adds one row and closes the modal.
- Company information and company management are not shown in the slice.
- No real auth/RBAC enforcement, DB/API persistence, email invite, access deletion, Autodesk cloud/API, paid SDK, customer drawing, or deployment action is required.
- Browser console has no errors during open, search, select, add, duplicate validation, cancel, and close flows.
- Desktop and narrow/mobile widths do not show overlapping text, clipped button labels, or broken modal layout.

## Manual Checks For Build Shell And Sheets List

Reference screenshots:

- `reference/acc-screenshots/Video Screen1781231464329.png`
- `reference/acc-screenshots/Video Screen1781231492911.png`

Pass/fail checks:

- Project list exposes a local path to open Build for `Study_Project`.
- Build shell shows project context and a left rail with `홈`, `시트`, `파일`, `이슈`, `양식`, `사진`, plus bottom admin items.
- `시트` is selected in the left rail.
- Sheets table shows local mock sheet rows for `Study_Project`.
- Sheets table includes thumbnail, number, version chip, version set, discipline, tags, last updater, and row menu affordance.
- Search filters by sheet number, title, discipline, or tag and clears back to all current sheet rows.
- List/grid view toggle changes the selected view affordance without requiring a separate grid implementation.
- Export, filter, row menu, and pagination remain local UI affordances only.
- Opening a 2D viewer, uploading/publishing sheets, version compare, file storage, markup, issues, Autodesk cloud/API, paid SDK, customer drawing, DB/API, auth/RBAC, and deployment are not required.
- Browser console has no errors during open, search, view toggle, and return-to-project-list flows when browser automation is available.
- Desktop and narrow/mobile widths do not show overlapping text, clipped labels, or broken shell/table layout.

## Manual Checks For 2D Sheet Viewer First Slice

Planning checks:

- `FR-SV-001` through `FR-SV-009` appear in `docs/PRD.md`.
- `FR-SV-001` through `FR-SV-009` appear in `docs/TRD.md`, `docs/UI_Spec.md`, `docs/Data_Model.md`, `docs/Task_List.md`, `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`, `docs/Test_Scenarios.md`, `docs/Design_Map.md`, and `docs/User_Flow.md`.
- `T-SV-001` through `T-SV-009` appear in `docs/Task_List.md`.
- `AC-SV-001` through `AC-SV-009` appear in `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`.
- `TS-SV-001` through `TS-SV-009` appear in `docs/Test_Scenarios.md`.
- `UF-SV-*` flow steps appear in `docs/User_Flow.md`.
- `docs/Data_Model.md` reserves `equipmentEntityIdSlot` or equivalent as local state only.
- `HUMAN_GATE.md` still gates real viewer engine, customer drawings, DB/API/TypeDB/schema, Autodesk API, paid SDK, CAD editor scope, and deployment.
- `docs/Planning_Gate_Checklist.md` records formal planning-gate PASS only after the live traceability checks have been run.
- `docs/Task_List.md` keeps T-SV implementation work as planned/gate-ready, not done.

Future implementation pass/fail checks after planning gate:

- Build sheets list exposes a local action to open a selected mock sheet in the viewer shell.
- Viewer shell shows `Study_Project`, selected sheet number/title, and a return path to the sheets list.
- Central sheet area renders a static local sheet representation without loading customer drawings or parsed files.
- Right tool rail renders select, move, text, shape, pen, measurement, stamp, and color affordances.
- Bottom controls render pan, fit, zoom, fullscreen, compare, and measure affordances without claiming real engine behavior.
- Markup and issue panel tabs switch locally and show empty states without creating records.
- Optional filmstrip/sheet navigation uses local mock sheets only.
- No real viewer engine, upload/publish, version compare, persisted markup/issues, Autodesk cloud/API, paid SDK, customer drawing, DB/API, auth/RBAC, TypeDB/schema, or deployment action is required.
- Browser console has no errors during open, tool selection, panel switching, and return-to-sheets flows when browser automation is available.
- Desktop and narrow/mobile widths do not show overlapping text, clipped labels, or broken viewer controls.

## Planning Checks For DWG/DXF Upload Conversion Management

These checks are for the DUC document/planning slice only. They do not authorize production upload, customer drawings, Autodesk/APS API use, ODA product adoption, DB/API/schema, TypeDB, auth/RBAC, or deployment.

Reference evidence:

- `reference/old-prototypes/prototype-도면지식관리-mvp/docs/ai-3d-builder/_archive-dxf-pivot-2026-04-22/parity-lab-p062/FINDINGS.md`
- `reference/old-prototypes/prototype-도면지식관리-mvp/docs/ai-3d-builder/_archive-dxf-pivot-2026-04-22/parity-lab-p062/SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-04-21.md`
- Autodesk Platform Services Simple Viewer tutorial: upload, translate, and preview 2D/3D designs.
- Autodesk Platform Services Viewer SDK overview.
- Autodesk Platform Services Model Derivative API overview.

Planning pass/fail checks:

- `FR-DUC-001` through `FR-DUC-010` appear in `docs/PRD.md`.
- `FR-DUC-001` through `FR-DUC-010` appear in `docs/TRD.md`, `docs/UI_Spec.md`, `docs/Data_Model.md`, `docs/Task_List.md`, `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`, `docs/Test_Scenarios.md`, `docs/Design_Map.md`, and `docs/User_Flow.md`.
- `T-DUC-001` through `T-DUC-010` appear in `docs/Task_List.md`.
- `AC-DUC-001` through `AC-DUC-010` appear in `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`.
- `TS-DUC-001` through `TS-DUC-010` appear in `docs/Test_Scenarios.md`.
- `UF-DUC-*` flow steps appear in `docs/User_Flow.md`.
- DUC documents keep ACC #11 local viewer shell work separate from upload/conversion work.
- DUC documents distinguish conversion metadata extraction from viewer rendering quality.
- DUC documents record that Chrome DevTools/Network inspection can help understand Autodesk web viewer behavior only when there is legitimate account/session access, and captured tokens must not be committed.
- DUC documents record that official APS Simple Viewer architecture uses Authentication, Data Management, Model Derivative, and Viewer, but real APS use remains HUMAN_GATE.
- DUC documents record that initial JSON/structured progress output is a proposed traceability artifact for the next loop, not an existing production contract.

Local experiment verification commands, when explicitly approved for a future implementation/spike session:

```powershell
Test-Path 'C:\Program Files\ODA\ODAFileConverter 27.1.0\ODAFileConverter.exe'
python --version
python -c "import importlib.util; print('ezdxf', bool(importlib.util.find_spec('ezdxf'))); print('fitz', bool(importlib.util.find_spec('fitz')))"
git diff --name-only -- src package.json package-lock.json reference docs/evidence evidence .ai-loop
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Force -LiteralPath '.ai-loop' | Where-Object { $_.Name -match '0009' }
```

Expected boundaries:

- Reference DWG files are read-only.
- Temporary conversion output must stay outside the repo or in an explicitly approved ignored scratch path.
- No product source/package changes are implied by this planning check.
- No browser evidence from DUC may be reused for Project Admin Task 6.
