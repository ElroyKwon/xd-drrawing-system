# Project Plan

## Phase 0: Project Setup

- [x] Create project root at `D:\_Project\xd-drawing-system`
- [x] Create reference, docs, public, local skill folders
- [x] Copy ACC screenshots and analysis
- [x] Copy DKS design and Autodesk Cloud references
- [x] Copy old prototype reference materials without build artifacts
- [x] Copy AI development loop package
- [x] Add project instruction files
- [x] Verify final file counts and key paths

Verification status:

- Core paths checked on 2026-06-15.
- `reference/acc-screenshots`: 39 files.
- `reference/dks-design-docs/도면관리시스템_상세설계`: 92 files.
- Setup evidence is recorded in `EVIDENCE.md`.

## Phase 1: First Implementation Slice

Selected slice:

- `#1 프로젝트 작성 모달`
- `#6 프로젝트 목록`

Before implementation:

- [x] Identify exact screenshot files for the selected slice.
- [x] Write feature note in `docs/feature-notes/001-initial-setup.md`.
- [x] Update `SPEC.md` and `CHECKS.md` for the selected slice.
- [x] Run a planning gate before code changes.

Planning gate status:

- Result: TEMPORARY PASS on 2026-06-15.
- This was a feature-note-based interim pass, not a full pass against the original loop's seven-document standard.
- Before implementation, reinforce the local skill/check workflow and re-enter the initial setup slice.
- Local skills were reinforced to include `feature-docs-scaffold` and `development-loop-orchestrator`.
- Local `.agents/skills` and `.claude/skills` copies were refreshed on 2026-06-15; duplicate nested skill directories were removed.
- Next gate must create or validate the seven core documents before implementation.

Document-loop re-entry plan:

- [x] Run `development-loop-orchestrator` to determine current stage.
- [x] Run `feature-docs-scaffold` for the initial setup slice.
- [x] Create or update `docs/PRD.md`.
- [x] Create or update `docs/TRD.md`.
- [x] Create or update `docs/UI_Spec.md`.
- [x] Create or update `docs/Data_Model.md`.
- [x] Create or update `docs/Task_List.md`.
- [x] Create or update `docs/Acceptance_Criteria.md`.
- [x] Create or update `docs/Test_Scenarios.md`.
- [x] Run enhanced `planning-gate`.
- [x] Confirm implementation eligibility only after full `PASS` or explicitly accepted `SLICE-ONLY PASS`.

Enhanced planning gate status:

- Result: PASS on 2026-06-15.
- Basis: seven core documents exist and FR-IS-001 through FR-IS-009 map to tasks, acceptance criteria, test scenarios, UI/data support, and local-only boundaries.
- UI support documents also exist: `docs/Design_Map.md`, `docs/User_Flow.md`, `docs/Planning_Gate_Checklist.md`.
- Implementation is not started in this session because the session objective is AI development loop skill testing only.

Implementation plan after gate:

- [ ] Choose app scaffold and package scripts without changing `reference/`.
- [ ] Build a hub-level project list screen matching ACC #6 layout.
- [ ] Add local mock project data.
- [ ] Add search by project name or number.
- [ ] Add `+ 프로젝트 만들기` action.
- [ ] Build the ACC #1 project creation modal.
- [ ] Add required-name validation.
- [ ] Add local mock create flow that appends a project to the list.
- [ ] Add cancel and close flows that do not mutate the list.
- [ ] Run automated checks available in the app package.
- [ ] Run manual checks in `CHECKS.md`.
- [ ] Record implementation evidence in `EVIDENCE.md`.

Deferred slices:

1. Project Admin member/company/role screens
2. Build shell and Sheets list

## Operating Rule

Work one feature at a time. Do not build the whole ACC clone in one pass.
