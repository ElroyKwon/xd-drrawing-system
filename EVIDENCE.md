## Risks

- Initial app code now exists for the local mock initial setup slice.
- Current app data is not persistent; reload returns to the default mock rows.
- Filter/settings/pagination are layout affordances only in the first implementation slice.
- `reference/Development_Design_legacy` is copied for history only; current direction is `도면관리시스템_상세설계`.
- `reference/old-prototypes` is reference-only and should not be treated as the new app baseline.

Build/debug notes:

```text
Date: 2026-06-15
Command: npm run build
Result: FAIL then fixed
Observed:
  TS5107: moduleResolution=node10 is deprecated in TypeScript 7.0 path.
Root cause:
  tsconfig.json used moduleResolution "Node", which current TypeScript interpreted as deprecated node10.
Fix:
  Changed moduleResolution to "Bundler".

Date: 2026-06-15
Command: npm run build
Result: FAIL then fixed
Observed:
  Missing declaration files for react, react-dom/client, react/jsx-runtime, and side-effect CSS import.
Root cause:
  Scaffold was missing @types/react, @types/react-dom, and Vite client type reference.
Fix:
  Installed React type packages and added src/vite-env.d.ts.
```

Browser verification:

    Empty submit showed "프로젝트 이름을 입력하세요.", kept modal open, and kept list count unchanged.
    Valid submit with "XD Pilot Project" / "XD-900" added one local row and closed the modal.
    Search by "XD-900" reduced list to the created row.
    Search by "Seaport" reduced list to the matching existing row.
    Keyboard clear restored the full list.
    취소 with partial data closed modal and kept list count at 2.

Non-blocking execution notes:

```text
Date: 2026-06-15
Command: New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -LiteralPath docs/evidence
Result: FAIL, then retried successfully with -Path
Reason:

Date: 2026-06-15
Command: PowerShell process cleanup query for vite/5173/xd-drawing-system
Result: FAIL
Reason:
  The matching expression included the current PowerShell command line and terminated that shell invocation.

## Session Closeout

```text
Date: 2026-06-15
Agent: Codex
Closeout scope:
  Updated stale session handoff and technical docs after the initial setup implementation.
Updated:
  README.md
  CHECKS.md
  HUMAN_GATE.md
  docs/TRD.md
  docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md
  EVIDENCE.md
Notes:
  NEXT_SESSION.md now starts from the completed local mock initial setup slice.
  TRD.md now describes the implemented Vite + React + TypeScript + Vitest baseline.
  CHECKS.md now treats npm test / npm run build as current app checks, not future placeholders.

Final closeout verification:
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed.
  npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed.
  stale handoff wording search: PASS, no stale "no app code" or "do not start implementation" wording remains in checked docs.
  dev server: stopped after verification; http://127.0.0.1:5173 no longer responded.

  Observed:
    Test Files: 1 passed
    Tests: 6 passed

  npm run build
  Result: PASS
  Observed:
    tsc && vite build completed.

  Project creation modal open: PASS
  Required-name validation: PASS
  Valid local mock row create: PASS
  Search by created project number: PASS
  Search clear/full-list restore: PASS
  Cancel no-change flow: PASS
  Close no-change flow: PASS

Evidence files:
  docs/evidence/validator-current-desktop.png
  docs/evidence/validator-current-mobile-list.png

Non-blocking note:
  Chrome DevTools Issues reported form field id/name accessibility issues.
  This was recorded as non-blocking because the validator-loop console check found no browser console errors.

Remaining risks:
  No new modal screenshot was created in this validator-loop run.
  UI state remains local mock state only and resets on reload.
  Filter/settings/pagination remain layout affordances for this slice.

Human approval items:
  None triggered.
  Auth, permission, DB schema, customer data, Autodesk cloud/API, paid SDK, deployment, destructive data changes, and CAD editor scope remain out of scope.

Next action:
  If the accessibility issue should be addressed, create a separate bugfix/document loop item before changing implementation.
  Otherwise continue only to the next approved slice after its planning gate.
```

## Session Closeout - Validator Evidence Handoff

```text
Date: 2026-06-15
Agent: Codex
Closeout scope:
  Closed the session after recording the current validator-loop result.
Updated:
  EVIDENCE.md
  docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md
Not changed:
  Implementation code
  Reference files
Verification:
  No new test/build/browser verification was run during this closeout.
  This closeout relies on the immediately preceding validator-loop result recorded above.
Current validated baseline:
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed
  npm run build: PASS
  npm run dev -- --port 5173: PASS during validator-loop; server was stopped after validation
  Desktop browser check: PASS
  Mobile browser check: PASS
  Browser console errors: none observed
Evidence files:
  docs/evidence/validator-current-desktop.png
  docs/evidence/validator-current-mobile-list.png
Remaining risks:
  No new modal screenshot was created in the latest validator-loop run.
  Chrome DevTools Issues reported a non-blocking form field id/name accessibility issue.
  UI data remains local mock state only and resets on reload.
Human approval items:
  None triggered.
Next session entry:
  Read docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md first after AGENTS.md and the root loop files.
  Decide whether to handle the non-blocking accessibility issue before selecting the next product slice.
```

## Current Status Check - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  User-requested check of the last recorded work, previous work, and next work.
  No implementation code or reference files were changed.

Commands run:
  git status --short
  npm test
  npm run build

Validation Result: PASS for automated test/build checks

Observed:
  git status --short shows the current implementation baseline is still dirty/uncommitted after commit 054e754 Initial project baseline.
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed.
  npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed.

Not run:
  npm run dev -- --port 5173
  Browser desktop/mobile verification

Remaining risks:
  No new browser or modal screenshot was created in this status check.
  The previously recorded non-blocking form field id/name accessibility issue remains a candidate bugfix slice.
  UI data remains local mock state only and resets on reload.

Next action:
  Preserve or commit the current validated baseline before starting the next product slice.
  Then either handle the accessibility issue as a small bugfix slice or choose one next product slice and re-enter the document loop.
```

## AI Loop Hook Test Scaffold - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  Created a test-scope file based hook scaffold under .ai-loop.
  Created a PowerShell watcher for review-only Codex worker requests.
  No implementation behavior was changed.

Created:
  .ai-loop/README.md
  .ai-loop/prompts/baseline-review.md
  .ai-loop/control/inbox/0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal.request.md
  .ai-loop/state/loop-state.json
  scripts/ai-loop/run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1
  scripts/ai-loop/watch-ai-loop.ps1
  scripts/ai-loop/test-ai-loop-hook.ps1

Dry-run generated:
  .ai-loop/control/processed/0001-baseline-review.request.md
  .ai-loop/control/outbox/0001-baseline-review.done.md
  .ai-loop/workers/codex/results/0001-baseline-review.result.md

Commands run:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once -DryRun
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  npm test
  npm run build

Validation Result:
  AI loop hook scaffold verification: PASS
  Watcher dry-run: PASS, processed request 0001-baseline-review without launching Codex worker
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed
  npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed

Current queued worker request:
  .ai-loop/control/inbox/0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal.request.md

Next command for a real worker run:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once

Safety boundary:
  The current watcher supports review-only mode only.
  It runs Codex with read-only sandbox:
    codex exec -C <project> -s read-only -o <result> -
  It does not pass an approval-policy flag because some local codex exec versions reject -a/--ask-for-approval.
  File edits, commits, dependency installs, external APIs, DB/Auth/permission changes, and deployment remain blocked by prompt and mode policy.

Remaining risks:
  A real Codex worker run has not been executed yet in this scaffold session.
  The loop is not a general automatic development loop yet.
  Result files should be reviewed before enabling validation-only, doc-update, or implementation modes.
```

## AI Loop Runner Rename - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  Renamed the AI terminal execution command from watcher wording to runner wording.
  Added scripts/ai-loop/run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 as the primary command.
  Kept scripts/ai-loop/watch-ai-loop.ps1 as a compatibility wrapper.

Reason:
  The current tool runs the next queued request on demand from an AI terminal.
  It is not yet a persistent hook daemon.

Queued real worker request:
  .ai-loop/control/inbox/0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal.request.md

Primary command for the AI terminal:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once

Commands run:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once -DryRun
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  PowerShell parser check for run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 and watch-ai-loop.ps1
  npm test
  npm run build

Validation Result:
  Runner dry-run: PASS, processed request 0002-baseline-review-real-run without launching Codex worker
  AI loop hook scaffold verification: PASS
  PowerShell parse check: PASS
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed
  npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed

Note:
  A first parser check attempt failed because the check command itself had nested PowerShell quoting errors.
  The direct parser check passed afterward.
```

## AI Loop Runner Compatibility Fix - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  Fixed the review-only runner after an AI terminal run reported codex exec rejected `-a never`.

Root cause:
  scripts/ai-loop/run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 called:
    codex exec -C <project> -s read-only -a never -o <result> -
  The other AI terminal's Codex CLI did not support `-a never` for `codex exec`.

Fix:
  Removed the unsupported approval-policy flag.
  The runner now calls:
    codex exec -C <project> -s read-only -o <result> -

Safety boundary:
  The worker still runs in read-only sandbox mode.
  Prompt and mode policy still block edits, commits, dependency installs, external APIs, DB/Auth/permission changes, and deployment.
```

## AI Loop Runner Windows Shim Fix - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  Adjusted the runner to prefer codex.cmd on Windows.

Root cause:
  Calling `codex` from Windows PowerShell can resolve to the npm PowerShell shim `codex.ps1`.
  In the failed run, that shim surfaced native command stderr as a PowerShell NativeCommandError.

Fix:
  scripts/ai-loop/run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 now resolves `codex.cmd` first.
  If `codex.cmd` is not available, it falls back to `codex`.

Primary command still remains:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once
```

## AI Loop Runner Real Worker Run - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  Re-ran the pending 0003 baseline review request through the local Codex runner.
  Hardened the runner after the first real run exposed Windows native-command and encoding/runtime-artifact issues.

Commands run:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  PowerShell parser check for run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1, watch-ai-loop.ps1, and test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  npm test
  npm run build

Validation Result:
  Real worker runner mechanics: PASS, processed request 0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal
  Outbox event created: .ai-loop/control/outbox/0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal.done.md
  Human-facing result created: .ai-loop/results/0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal.result.md
  AI loop hook scaffold verification: PASS
  PowerShell parse check: PASS
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed
  npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed

Worker review result:
  The worker conclusion was 수정 후 커밋.
  It repeated the stale document blockers in docs/TRD.md and docs/Test_Scenarios.md.
  It also flagged docs/Task_List.md and docs/Planning_Gate_Checklist.md as stale planning-era documents.
  The worker's npm test and npm run build attempts failed inside read-only sandbox with EPERM on node_modules/.vite-temp.
  Writable local verification in this session passed npm test and npm run build, so the EPERM result is a worker sandbox limitation, not product-code failure evidence.

Runner fixes after real run:
  Removed the unsupported codex exec -a never flag.
  Preferred codex.cmd on Windows.
  Switched native Codex execution to Start-Process with redirected stdin/stdout/stderr.
  Added UTF-8 console and child-process environment settings for future Korean worker output.
  Added cleanup for temporary prompt/stdout/stderr files.
  Added .gitignore rules so .ai-loop runtime requests/results/logs/locks are not staged as baseline source artifacts.

Remaining risks:
  The 0003 worker result text is Korean mojibake from the pre-UTF-8 hardening run. Treat it as mechanically useful but not as clean human-readable evidence.
  The UTF-8 hardening has passed source-level scaffold checks, but a fresh real worker run after that hardening has not been executed yet.
  Continuous polling mode exists, but was not left running as a background daemon in this session.
```

## Session Closeout - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Purpose:
  Close the session with a durable next-session handoff.

State at close:
  The first product slice remains implemented but uncommitted.
  The repo is still dirty by design.
  The .ai-loop review-only runner scaffold exists and has processed one real Codex worker request.
  Runtime .ai-loop request/result/log/lock artifacts are now ignored by .gitignore.
  The current AI loop is not complete automation; it is an external PowerShell polling runner around codex exec.

Fresh verification from this closeout session:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    PASS
  PowerShell parser check for run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1, watch-ai-loop.ps1, and test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    PASS
  npm test
    PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed
  npm run build
    PASS, tsc && vite build completed

Next-session first task:
  Fix stale planning-era wording before committing the baseline:
    docs/TRD.md
    docs/Test_Scenarios.md
    docs/Task_List.md
    docs/Planning_Gate_Checklist.md

Next-session second task:
  Re-run:
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    npm test
    npm run build

Next-session third task:
  Decide commit split:
    product baseline
    local skill loop reinforcement
    ai-loop scaffold

Known limitations to carry forward:
  The 0003 worker result is mechanically valid but Korean text is mojibake.
  UTF-8 hardening has not yet been verified by a fresh real worker run.
  Browser/dev-server verification was not rerun during this closeout.
  Form field id/name accessibility issue remains a non-blocking later bugfix slice.
```

## Stale Planning Document Cleanup - 2026-06-17

```text
Date: 2026-06-17
Agent: Codex
Purpose:
  Resume from the 2026-06-16 closeout by fixing stale planning-era wording before baseline commit decisions.

Updated:
  docs/TRD.md
  docs/Test_Scenarios.md
  docs/Task_List.md
  docs/Planning_Gate_Checklist.md

Changes:
  TRD now describes the implemented Vite + React + TypeScript + Vitest baseline instead of a future no-scaffold state.
  Test_Scenarios now describes active checks for the implemented local mock initial setup slice.
  Task_List now marks the initial setup slice traceability tasks as Done.
  Planning_Gate_Checklist now separates pre-implementation gate boundaries from post-gate implementation status.

Stale wording search:
  rg check for old planning-era phrases across the four updated docs returned no matches.

Verification:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    PASS
  npm test
    PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed.
  npm run build
    PASS, tsc && vite build completed.

Not run:
  npm run dev -- --port 5173
  Browser desktop/mobile verification

Next action:
  Decide commit split:
    product baseline
    local skill loop reinforcement
    ai-loop scaffold
  Keep .ai-loop runtime requests/results/logs/locks out of commits.
```

## Commit Split and Project Admin Planning - 2026-06-17

```text
Date: 2026-06-17
Agent: Codex
Purpose:
  Close the post-cleanup session after committing the current baseline and preparing the next product slice.

Completed commit split:
  2f20dc9 feat: implement initial setup project slice
  9ac41aa chore: refresh local ai loop skills
  c6dafeb chore: add review-only ai loop scaffold
  b051f93 docs: update evidence and next session handoff

Project Admin planning commits:
  e47e8a8 docs: design project admin member access slice
  85dd1cc docs: plan project admin member access implementation

User-confirmed product boundary:
  Project and Member are peer resources.
  Project admins grant project-specific member access.
  One member can belong to multiple projects with different roles.
  Company information is excluded from this slice.
  HTML viewer/visual work should be created only when explicitly requested.

Created:
  docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-project-admin-member-access-design.md
  docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-project-admin-member-access.md

No implementation code changed for Project Admin:
  src/ProjectAdminView.tsx was not created.
  src/projectAdminData.ts was not created.
  src/App.tsx was not changed for Project Admin.

Verification:
  No fresh npm test/build/browser verification was run after the Project Admin design and plan commits.
  The most recent automated verification remains the stale-document cleanup pass recorded above:
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1: PASS
    npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed.
    npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed.

Next action:
  Start the next session from Task 0 in docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-project-admin-member-access.md.
  Do not start Project Admin implementation code before the feature-doc updates and planning gate pass.
```

## Project Admin Member Access Document Loop - 2026-06-17

## AI Loop Runner Mode Dispatch - 2026-06-17

```text
Date: 2026-06-17
Agent: Codex
Purpose:
  Extend the review-only .ai-loop runner into explicit mode dispatch while preserving review-only behavior.

Updated:
  scripts/ai-loop/run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1
  scripts/ai-loop/test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  .ai-loop/README.md
  .ai-loop/prompts/validation-evidence.md
  .ai-loop/prompts/implementation.md
  .ai-loop/state/loop-state.json
  CHECKS.md
  EVIDENCE.md
  docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md

TDD evidence:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    EXPECTED FAIL before implementation.
    Observed: Missing .ai-loop\prompts\validation-evidence.md.

Mode dispatch implementation:
  review-only:
    prompt: baseline-review.md
    sandbox: read-only
  validation-evidence:
    prompt: validation-evidence.md
    sandbox: workspace-write
    boundary: evidence/handoff only by default; implementation code edits are blocked unless explicitly authorized.
  implementation:
    prompt: implementation.md
    sandbox: workspace-write
    boundary: owned files and verification commands must be explicit in the request.
  unknown mode:
    fails before worker launch with Unsupported mode and the supported mode list.

Verification:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    PASS; AI loop hook scaffold verification passed.

  review-only dry-run fixture 9111-dispatch-review-dry-run
    PASS; Prompt baseline-review.md, Sandbox read-only.

  validation-evidence dry-run fixture 9112-dispatch-validation-evidence-dry-run
    PASS; Prompt validation-evidence.md, Sandbox workspace-write.

  implementation dry-run fixture 9113-dispatch-implementation-dry-run
    PASS; Prompt implementation.md, Sandbox workspace-write.

  unknown mode dry-run fixture 9120-dispatch-unknown-mode-dry-run
    EXPECTED FAIL; exit code 1.
    Observed: Unsupported mode 'unknown-mode'. Supported modes: review-only, validation-evidence, implementation.

Not run:
  Real Codex worker launch for validation-evidence or implementation modes.
  npm test / npm run build, because this change is limited to the file-based runner and prompt contracts.
  Browser/dev-server verification.

Remaining risks:
  workspace-write modes rely on request scope and worker prompt discipline to avoid broad edits.
  Real worker behavior for validation-evidence and implementation modes still needs a controlled non-dry-run request before treating those modes as production automation.
  Dry-run verification created ignored .ai-loop runtime request/result/log artifacts.
```

## Session Closeout - AI Loop Mode Dispatch Handoff - 2026-06-17

```text
Date: 2026-06-17

  real Codex worker launch for pending 0007

Next action:
  Start next session by reviewing this closeout, then run the pending 0007 validation-evidence request without -DryRun.
  If 0007 returns DRY-RUN, it does not count as validation evidence.
  The mode-dispatch and handoff changes are committed; do not rework them unless 0007 exposes a real runner issue.
