## Risks

- Initial app code now exists for the local mock initial setup slice.
- Current app data is not persistent; reload returns to the default mock rows.
- Filter/settings/pagination are layout affordances only in the first implementation slice.
- `reference/Development_Design_legacy` is copied for history only; current direction is `도면관리시스템_상세설계`.
- `reference/old-prototypes` is reference-only and should not be treated as the new app baseline.

Build/debug notes:

```text
Date: 2026-06-15
Command: npm run build
Result: FAIL then fixed
Observed:
  TS5107: moduleResolution=node10 is deprecated in TypeScript 7.0 path.
Root cause:
  tsconfig.json used moduleResolution "Node", which current TypeScript interpreted as deprecated node10.
Fix:
  Changed moduleResolution to "Bundler".

Date: 2026-06-15
Command: npm run build
Result: FAIL then fixed
Observed:
  Missing declaration files for react, react-dom/client, react/jsx-runtime, and side-effect CSS import.
Root cause:
  Scaffold was missing @types/react, @types/react-dom, and Vite client type reference.
Fix:
  Installed React type packages and added src/vite-env.d.ts.
```

Browser verification:

    Empty submit showed "프로젝트 이름을 입력하세요.", kept modal open, and kept list count unchanged.
    Valid submit with "XD Pilot Project" / "XD-900" added one local row and closed the modal.
    Search by "XD-900" reduced list to the created row.
    Search by "Seaport" reduced list to the matching existing row.
    Keyboard clear restored the full list.
    취소 with partial data closed modal and kept list count at 2.

Non-blocking execution notes:

```text
Date: 2026-06-15
Command: New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -LiteralPath docs/evidence
Result: FAIL, then retried successfully with -Path
Reason:

Date: 2026-06-15
Command: PowerShell process cleanup query for vite/5173/xd-drawing-system
Result: FAIL
Reason:
  The matching expression included the current PowerShell command line and terminated that shell invocation.

## Session Closeout

```text
Date: 2026-06-15
Agent: Codex
Closeout scope:
  Updated stale session handoff and technical docs after the initial setup implementation.
Updated:
  README.md
  CHECKS.md
  HUMAN_GATE.md
  docs/TRD.md
  docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md
  EVIDENCE.md
Notes:
  NEXT_SESSION.md now starts from the completed local mock initial setup slice.
  TRD.md now describes the implemented Vite + React + TypeScript + Vitest baseline.
  CHECKS.md now treats npm test / npm run build as current app checks, not future placeholders.

Final closeout verification:
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed.
  npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed.
  stale handoff wording search: PASS, no stale "no app code" or "do not start implementation" wording remains in checked docs.
  dev server: stopped after verification; http://127.0.0.1:5173 no longer responded.

  Observed:
    Test Files: 1 passed
    Tests: 6 passed

  npm run build
  Result: PASS
  Observed:
    tsc && vite build completed.

  Project creation modal open: PASS
  Required-name validation: PASS
  Valid local mock row create: PASS
  Search by created project number: PASS
  Search clear/full-list restore: PASS
  Cancel no-change flow: PASS
  Close no-change flow: PASS

Evidence files:
  docs/evidence/validator-current-desktop.png
  docs/evidence/validator-current-mobile-list.png

Non-blocking note:
  Chrome DevTools Issues reported form field id/name accessibility issues.
  This was recorded as non-blocking because the validator-loop console check found no browser console errors.

Remaining risks:
  No new modal screenshot was created in this validator-loop run.
  UI state remains local mock state only and resets on reload.
  Filter/settings/pagination remain layout affordances for this slice.

Human approval items:
  None triggered.
  Auth, permission, DB schema, customer data, Autodesk cloud/API, paid SDK, deployment, destructive data changes, and CAD editor scope remain out of scope.

Next action:
  If the accessibility issue should be addressed, create a separate bugfix/document loop item before changing implementation.
  Otherwise continue only to the next approved slice after its planning gate.
```

## Session Closeout - Validator Evidence Handoff

```text
Date: 2026-06-15
Agent: Codex
Closeout scope:
  Closed the session after recording the current validator-loop result.
Updated:
  EVIDENCE.md
  docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md
Not changed:
  Implementation code
  Reference files
Verification:
  No new test/build/browser verification was run during this closeout.
  This closeout relies on the immediately preceding validator-loop result recorded above.
Current validated baseline:
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed
  npm run build: PASS
  npm run dev -- --port 5173: PASS during validator-loop; server was stopped after validation
  Desktop browser check: PASS
  Mobile browser check: PASS
  Browser console errors: none observed
Evidence files:
  docs/evidence/validator-current-desktop.png
  docs/evidence/validator-current-mobile-list.png
Remaining risks:
  No new modal screenshot was created in the latest validator-loop run.
  Chrome DevTools Issues reported a non-blocking form field id/name accessibility issue.
  UI data remains local mock state only and resets on reload.
Human approval items:
  None triggered.
Next session entry:
  Read docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md first after AGENTS.md and the root loop files.
  Decide whether to handle the non-blocking accessibility issue before selecting the next product slice.
```

## Current Status Check - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  User-requested check of the last recorded work, previous work, and next work.
  No implementation code or reference files were changed.

Commands run:
  git status --short
  npm test
  npm run build

Validation Result: PASS for automated test/build checks

Observed:
  git status --short shows the current implementation baseline is still dirty/uncommitted after commit 054e754 Initial project baseline.
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed.
  npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed.

Not run:
  npm run dev -- --port 5173
  Browser desktop/mobile verification

Remaining risks:
  No new browser or modal screenshot was created in this status check.
  The previously recorded non-blocking form field id/name accessibility issue remains a candidate bugfix slice.
  UI data remains local mock state only and resets on reload.

Next action:
  Preserve or commit the current validated baseline before starting the next product slice.
  Then either handle the accessibility issue as a small bugfix slice or choose one next product slice and re-enter the document loop.
```

## AI Loop Hook Test Scaffold - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  Created a test-scope file based hook scaffold under .ai-loop.
  Created a PowerShell watcher for review-only Codex worker requests.
  No implementation behavior was changed.

Created:
  .ai-loop/README.md
  .ai-loop/prompts/baseline-review.md
  .ai-loop/control/inbox/0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal.request.md
  .ai-loop/state/loop-state.json
  scripts/ai-loop/run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1
  scripts/ai-loop/watch-ai-loop.ps1
  scripts/ai-loop/test-ai-loop-hook.ps1

Dry-run generated:
  .ai-loop/control/processed/0001-baseline-review.request.md
  .ai-loop/control/outbox/0001-baseline-review.done.md
  .ai-loop/workers/codex/results/0001-baseline-review.result.md

Commands run:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once -DryRun
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  npm test
  npm run build

Validation Result:
  AI loop hook scaffold verification: PASS
  Watcher dry-run: PASS, processed request 0001-baseline-review without launching Codex worker
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed
  npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed

Current queued worker request:
  .ai-loop/control/inbox/0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal.request.md

Next command for a real worker run:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once

Safety boundary:
  The current watcher supports review-only mode only.
  It runs Codex with read-only sandbox:
    codex exec -C <project> -s read-only -o <result> -
  It does not pass an approval-policy flag because some local codex exec versions reject -a/--ask-for-approval.
  File edits, commits, dependency installs, external APIs, DB/Auth/permission changes, and deployment remain blocked by prompt and mode policy.

Remaining risks:
  A real Codex worker run has not been executed yet in this scaffold session.
  The loop is not a general automatic development loop yet.
  Result files should be reviewed before enabling validation-only, doc-update, or implementation modes.
```

## AI Loop Runner Rename - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  Renamed the AI terminal execution command from watcher wording to runner wording.
  Added scripts/ai-loop/run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 as the primary command.
  Kept scripts/ai-loop/watch-ai-loop.ps1 as a compatibility wrapper.

Reason:
  The current tool runs the next queued request on demand from an AI terminal.
  It is not yet a persistent hook daemon.

Queued real worker request:
  .ai-loop/control/inbox/0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal.request.md

Primary command for the AI terminal:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once

Commands run:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once -DryRun
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  PowerShell parser check for run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 and watch-ai-loop.ps1
  npm test
  npm run build

Validation Result:
  Runner dry-run: PASS, processed request 0002-baseline-review-real-run without launching Codex worker
  AI loop hook scaffold verification: PASS
  PowerShell parse check: PASS
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed
  npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed

Note:
  A first parser check attempt failed because the check command itself had nested PowerShell quoting errors.
  The direct parser check passed afterward.
```

## AI Loop Runner Compatibility Fix - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  Fixed the review-only runner after an AI terminal run reported codex exec rejected `-a never`.

Root cause:
  scripts/ai-loop/run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 called:
    codex exec -C <project> -s read-only -a never -o <result> -
  The other AI terminal's Codex CLI did not support `-a never` for `codex exec`.

Fix:
  Removed the unsupported approval-policy flag.
  The runner now calls:
    codex exec -C <project> -s read-only -o <result> -

Safety boundary:
  The worker still runs in read-only sandbox mode.
  Prompt and mode policy still block edits, commits, dependency installs, external APIs, DB/Auth/permission changes, and deployment.
```

## AI Loop Runner Windows Shim Fix - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  Adjusted the runner to prefer codex.cmd on Windows.

Root cause:
  Calling `codex` from Windows PowerShell can resolve to the npm PowerShell shim `codex.ps1`.
  In the failed run, that shim surfaced native command stderr as a PowerShell NativeCommandError.

Fix:
  scripts/ai-loop/run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 now resolves `codex.cmd` first.
  If `codex.cmd` is not available, it falls back to `codex`.

Primary command still remains:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once
```

## AI Loop Runner Real Worker Run - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  Re-ran the pending 0003 baseline review request through the local Codex runner.
  Hardened the runner after the first real run exposed Windows native-command and encoding/runtime-artifact issues.

Commands run:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  PowerShell parser check for run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1, watch-ai-loop.ps1, and test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  npm test
  npm run build

Validation Result:
  Real worker runner mechanics: PASS, processed request 0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal
  Outbox event created: .ai-loop/control/outbox/0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal.done.md
  Human-facing result created: .ai-loop/results/0003-baseline-review-ai-terminal.result.md
  AI loop hook scaffold verification: PASS
  PowerShell parse check: PASS
  npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed
  npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed

Worker review result:
  The worker conclusion was 수정 후 커밋.
  It repeated the stale document blockers in docs/TRD.md and docs/Test_Scenarios.md.
  It also flagged docs/Task_List.md and docs/Planning_Gate_Checklist.md as stale planning-era documents.
  The worker's npm test and npm run build attempts failed inside read-only sandbox with EPERM on node_modules/.vite-temp.
  Writable local verification in this session passed npm test and npm run build, so the EPERM result is a worker sandbox limitation, not product-code failure evidence.

Runner fixes after real run:
  Removed the unsupported codex exec -a never flag.
  Preferred codex.cmd on Windows.
  Switched native Codex execution to Start-Process with redirected stdin/stdout/stderr.
  Added UTF-8 console and child-process environment settings for future Korean worker output.
  Added cleanup for temporary prompt/stdout/stderr files.
  Added .gitignore rules so .ai-loop runtime requests/results/logs/locks are not staged as baseline source artifacts.

Remaining risks:
  The 0003 worker result text is Korean mojibake from the pre-UTF-8 hardening run. Treat it as mechanically useful but not as clean human-readable evidence.
  The UTF-8 hardening has passed source-level scaffold checks, but a fresh real worker run after that hardening has not been executed yet.
  Continuous polling mode exists, but was not left running as a background daemon in this session.
```

## Session Closeout - 2026-06-16

```text
Date: 2026-06-16
Agent: Codex
Purpose:
  Close the session with a durable next-session handoff.

State at close:
  The first product slice remains implemented but uncommitted.
  The repo is still dirty by design.
  The .ai-loop review-only runner scaffold exists and has processed one real Codex worker request.
  Runtime .ai-loop request/result/log/lock artifacts are now ignored by .gitignore.
  The current AI loop is not complete automation; it is an external PowerShell polling runner around codex exec.

Fresh verification from this closeout session:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    PASS
  PowerShell parser check for run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1, watch-ai-loop.ps1, and test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    PASS
  npm test
    PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed
  npm run build
    PASS, tsc && vite build completed

Next-session first task:
  Fix stale planning-era wording before committing the baseline:
    docs/TRD.md
    docs/Test_Scenarios.md
    docs/Task_List.md
    docs/Planning_Gate_Checklist.md

Next-session second task:
  Re-run:
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    npm test
    npm run build

Next-session third task:
  Decide commit split:
    product baseline
    local skill loop reinforcement
    ai-loop scaffold

Known limitations to carry forward:
  The 0003 worker result is mechanically valid but Korean text is mojibake.
  UTF-8 hardening has not yet been verified by a fresh real worker run.
  Browser/dev-server verification was not rerun during this closeout.
  Form field id/name accessibility issue remains a non-blocking later bugfix slice.
```

## Stale Planning Document Cleanup - 2026-06-17

```text
Date: 2026-06-17
Agent: Codex
Purpose:
  Resume from the 2026-06-16 closeout by fixing stale planning-era wording before baseline commit decisions.

Updated:
  docs/TRD.md
  docs/Test_Scenarios.md
  docs/Task_List.md
  docs/Planning_Gate_Checklist.md

Changes:
  TRD now describes the implemented Vite + React + TypeScript + Vitest baseline instead of a future no-scaffold state.
  Test_Scenarios now describes active checks for the implemented local mock initial setup slice.
  Task_List now marks the initial setup slice traceability tasks as Done.
  Planning_Gate_Checklist now separates pre-implementation gate boundaries from post-gate implementation status.

Stale wording search:
  rg check for old planning-era phrases across the four updated docs returned no matches.

Verification:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    PASS
  npm test
    PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed.
  npm run build
    PASS, tsc && vite build completed.

Not run:
  npm run dev -- --port 5173
  Browser desktop/mobile verification

Next action:
  Decide commit split:
    product baseline
    local skill loop reinforcement
    ai-loop scaffold
  Keep .ai-loop runtime requests/results/logs/locks out of commits.
```

## Commit Split and Project Admin Planning - 2026-06-17

```text
Date: 2026-06-17
Agent: Codex
Purpose:
  Close the post-cleanup session after committing the current baseline and preparing the next product slice.

Completed commit split:
  2f20dc9 feat: implement initial setup project slice
  9ac41aa chore: refresh local ai loop skills
  c6dafeb chore: add review-only ai loop scaffold
  b051f93 docs: update evidence and next session handoff

Project Admin planning commits:
  e47e8a8 docs: design project admin member access slice
  85dd1cc docs: plan project admin member access implementation

User-confirmed product boundary:
  Project and Member are peer resources.
  Project admins grant project-specific member access.
  One member can belong to multiple projects with different roles.
  Company information is excluded from this slice.
  HTML viewer/visual work should be created only when explicitly requested.

Created:
  docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-project-admin-member-access-design.md
  docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-project-admin-member-access.md

No implementation code changed for Project Admin:
  src/ProjectAdminView.tsx was not created.
  src/projectAdminData.ts was not created.
  src/App.tsx was not changed for Project Admin.

Verification:
  No fresh npm test/build/browser verification was run after the Project Admin design and plan commits.
  The most recent automated verification remains the stale-document cleanup pass recorded above:
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1: PASS
    npm test: PASS, 1 test file / 6 tests passed.
    npm run build: PASS, tsc && vite build completed.

Next action:
  Start the next session from Task 0 in docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-project-admin-member-access.md.
  Do not start Project Admin implementation code before the feature-doc updates and planning gate pass.
```

## Project Admin Member Access Document Loop - 2026-06-17

## AI Loop Runner Mode Dispatch - 2026-06-17

```text
Date: 2026-06-17
Agent: Codex
Purpose:
  Extend the review-only .ai-loop runner into explicit mode dispatch while preserving review-only behavior.

Updated:
  scripts/ai-loop/run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1
  scripts/ai-loop/test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
  .ai-loop/README.md
  .ai-loop/prompts/validation-evidence.md
  .ai-loop/prompts/implementation.md
  .ai-loop/state/loop-state.json
  CHECKS.md
  EVIDENCE.md
  docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md

TDD evidence:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    EXPECTED FAIL before implementation.
    Observed: Missing .ai-loop\prompts\validation-evidence.md.

Mode dispatch implementation:
  review-only:
    prompt: baseline-review.md
    sandbox: read-only
  validation-evidence:
    prompt: validation-evidence.md
    sandbox: workspace-write
    boundary: evidence/handoff only by default; implementation code edits are blocked unless explicitly authorized.
  implementation:
    prompt: implementation.md
    sandbox: workspace-write
    boundary: owned files and verification commands must be explicit in the request.
  unknown mode:
    fails before worker launch with Unsupported mode and the supported mode list.

Verification:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ai-loop\test-ai-loop-hook.ps1
    PASS; AI loop hook scaffold verification passed.

  review-only dry-run fixture 9111-dispatch-review-dry-run
    PASS; Prompt baseline-review.md, Sandbox read-only.

  validation-evidence dry-run fixture 9112-dispatch-validation-evidence-dry-run
    PASS; Prompt validation-evidence.md, Sandbox workspace-write.

  implementation dry-run fixture 9113-dispatch-implementation-dry-run
    PASS; Prompt implementation.md, Sandbox workspace-write.

  unknown mode dry-run fixture 9120-dispatch-unknown-mode-dry-run
    EXPECTED FAIL; exit code 1.
    Observed: Unsupported mode 'unknown-mode'. Supported modes: review-only, validation-evidence, implementation.

Not run:
  Real Codex worker launch for validation-evidence or implementation modes.
  npm test / npm run build, because this change is limited to the file-based runner and prompt contracts.
  Browser/dev-server verification.

Remaining risks:
  workspace-write modes rely on request scope and worker prompt discipline to avoid broad edits.
  Real worker behavior for validation-evidence and implementation modes still needs a controlled non-dry-run request before treating those modes as production automation.
  Dry-run verification created ignored .ai-loop runtime request/result/log artifacts.
```

## Session Closeout - AI Loop Mode Dispatch Handoff - 2026-06-17

```text
Date: 2026-06-17

  Project Admin member-access Task 6 validation evidence only.
  Implementation code was not edited.

Validation Result:
  BLOCKED

Fresh command evidence:
  git status --short --untracked-files=all
    PASS; no output, working tree had no tracked or untracked changes before evidence edits.

  npm test
    PASS; 3 test files passed, 16 tests passed.

    http://127.0.0.1:5173/
  Requested viewports:
    Desktop 1440x900
    Narrow/mobile 390x844
  Browser tool attempts:
    Chrome DevTools MCP list_pages succeeded and showed about:blank.
    Chrome DevTools MCP navigate_page to http://127.0.0.1:5173/ returned "user cancelled MCP tool call".
    Retried navigate_page returned the same result.
    Chrome DevTools MCP new_page returned the same result.
    Chrome DevTools MCP evaluate_script on about:blank returned the same result.
  Fallback attempts:
    Local Vite dev server responded at http://127.0.0.1:5173/.
    Local Chrome executable found at C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe.
    Browser-level Chrome CDP Browser.getVersion succeeded.
    Page/session-level CDP automation timed out on Page.enable and Runtime.evaluate, so UI interaction evidence was not captured.
    Playwright, @playwright/test, puppeteer, and puppeteer-core are not installed in node_modules.
  Console state:
    Not verified. Browser page actions could not be executed.
  Screenshots created in this run:
    None.
  Existing evidence file present:
    docs/evidence/project-admin-desktop.png
  Evidence file usage:
    Existing project-admin-desktop.png was not treated as fresh Task 6 browser validation evidence for this run.

Previous project-document evidence kept separate:
  0004 review result recorded Task 6 as validation/evidence/handoff incomplete.
  0005 review result recorded validation-evidence mode readiness work only.
  0006 is not used as validation evidence because the 0007 request explicitly excluded it.

Runner real-run / dry-run status:
  This validation did not use `-DryRun` output.
  Fresh commands above were executed in this worker session.
  This worker did not launch a nested `run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 -Once` command because it was not one of the required verification commands and would risk double-processing the same request.
  From inside this worker, external runner-launch provenance is not independently verifiable beyond the request context.

  EVIDENCE.md
  docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md

Files not changed:
  src/
  package.json
  package-lock.json
  CHECKS.md
  PLAN.md
  reference/

Remaining risks:
  Project Admin browser/manual checks are still not complete.
  Browser console state for Project Admin is still not verified.
  Desktop/narrow Project Admin screenshots from this run do not exist.
  The existing project-admin-desktop.png may be useful as a prior artifact, but it is not fresh evidence for this request.

Human approval items:
  None triggered.
  No auth/RBAC, DB/API persistence, email invite, company management, deletion, Autodesk cloud/API, paid SDK, customer drawing, deployment, or implementation code work was performed.

Next action:
  Orchestrator should keep Task 6 open.
  Re-run Project Admin Task 6 in an environment where browser page navigation/evaluation works, or provide an authorized browser automation path.
  Do not mark Project Admin member-access validation PASS until desktop/narrow browser checks, console state, and fresh screenshot paths are recorded.

  Dev server attempt:
    npm.cmd run dev -- --port 5173 was started by Start-Process.
    The returned process id was 5052, but cleanup later reported no process with that id.
  Browser tool attempts:
    Chrome DevTools MCP list_pages failed before page interaction:
      The browser is already running for C:\Users\cruel\.cache\chrome-devtools-mcp\chrome-profile.
      The tool advised using --isolated or a different userDataDir, or stopping the running browser first.
    Chrome DevTools MCP new_page to http://127.0.0.1:5173/ returned "user cancelled MCP tool call".
    Chrome DevTools MCP navigate_page to http://127.0.0.1:5173/ returned "user cancelled MCP tool call".
    Chrome DevTools MCP select_page returned the same chrome-profile already-running blocker.
  Fallback attempts:
    PowerShell Start-Process for a separate Chrome remote-debugging process was rejected by policy before execution.
    Node REPL fallback failed with "windows sandbox failed: spawn setup refresh", including after kernel reset and a simple smoke test.
    Get-CimInstance Win32_Process to identify the locked chrome-devtools-mcp profile process failed with access denied.
  Console state:
    Not verified. No browser page-level automation path was available.
  Screenshots created in this run:
    None.
  Evidence screenshot files:
    docs/evidence/project-admin-task6-desktop.png was not created or reused.
    docs/evidence/project-admin-task6-narrow.png was not created or reused.

Previous project-document evidence kept separate:
  0007 remains the previous blocked validation-evidence run.
  This 0008 run provides fresh command evidence and a fresh browser availability blocker, but no Project Admin browser PASS evidence.

Runner real-run / dry-run status:
  This was a real worker run in the current session, not dry-run output.
  The required commands above were executed fresh in this session.
  A nested run-next-ai-loop-request.ps1 was not executed because it was not one of the required checks for 0008.

  Narrow viewport:
    390x844 mobile emulated viewport.
    PASS.
    Observed:
      Build shell opened from the project list.
      Mobile rail collapsed to icon-first layout while retaining accessible button names.
      Sheets list remained scrollable without requiring viewer/upload/backend behavior.

Human approval items:
  None triggered.
  No real auth/RBAC, DB/API, Autodesk cloud/API, paid SDK, customer drawing, deployment, destructive data change, or dependency install was performed.

Project Admin Task 6 status:
  Still open.
  This Build slice browser evidence is not Project Admin Task 6 evidence.
  No 0009 Task 6 validation rerun was created.
  Do not mark Project Admin Task 6 PASS until its own fresh Project Admin browser interaction, console state, and desktop/narrow screenshot paths are recorded after a changed browser automation precondition is documented.

Next action:
  Review and commit the Build shell + Sheets list slice if accepted.
  Keep Project Admin Task 6 as a separate blocker-resolution item.

Build slice review:
  Result: PASS for commit readiness.
  Source diff is scoped to local mock Build shell, sheet metadata data helper, view tests, App navigation wiring, CSS, docs, and evidence screenshots.
  No package/dependency, reference, DB/API/Auth/RBAC, Autodesk API, paid SDK, customer drawing, deployment, 2D viewer, upload/publish, or Project Admin Task 6 PASS change was introduced.

Progress-doc consistency:
  Updated docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-build-shell-sheets-list.md Tasks 1-4 from open checkboxes to completed checkboxes.
  PLAN.md, EVIDENCE.md, docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md, docs/Task_List.md, CHECKS.md, HUMAN_GATE.md, and SPEC.md are consistent with Build slice completion and Project Admin Task 6 remaining blocked.

  Task 6 browser validation was not rerun.
  Build browser evidence was not treated as Project Admin evidence.

Commit guidance:
  Recommended split:
    1. Build shell + Sheets list code/docs/evidence.
    2. ai-loop skill/prompt reinforcement.
    3. Task 6 blocker handoff / closeout docs if staging can separate shared files cleanly.
  Shared files EVIDENCE.md and docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md contain multiple groups, so use partial staging if separate commits are desired.

Commit/push:
  Not performed. User approval is required before commit.

## Post-Commit Handoff Cleanup - 2026-06-18

```text
Date: 2026-06-18
Agent: Codex
Mode:
  Direct subagent orchestration plus main-session integration.

Scope:
  Post-commit handoff cleanup after:
    c3022d9 docs: record task 6 blocker handoff
    835168a chore: reinforce ai loop blocker handling
    3d418e1 feat: add build shell sheets list
  No new feature implementation.
  No Project Admin Task 6 browser validation rerun.
  No 0009 request created.

Subagent assignments:
  Assignment A - post-commit handoff mismatch review:
    Result: HANDOFF_CLEANUP_NEEDED.
    Finding: live NEXT_SESSION wording still used "Commit-ready review rerun".
    Main-session action: replaced it with post-commit closeout verification wording.

  Assignment B - Task_List / PLAN / SPEC / README consistency review:
    Result: DOC_CONSISTENCY_NEEDED.
    Finding: Project Admin T-PA-* status should remain Code Done / Browser Blocked; Build slice section still said before implementation.
    Main-session action: kept T-PA-* as Code Done / Browser Blocked and changed the Build task section to implemented-slice wording.

  Assignment C - next slice candidate comparison:
    Result: RECOMMEND_READY for decision, not implementation-ready.
    Finding: next planning slice should be ACC #11 2D sheet viewer first slice design.
    Main-session action: recorded the recommendation and pre-decision in PLAN.md and docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md.

Documents updated:
  PLAN.md
  docs/Task_List.md
  docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md
  EVIDENCE.md

Previously dirty post-commit cleanup docs preserved:
  README.md
  SPEC.md

Product check status vs evidence-path status:
  Build shell + Sheets list remains PASS based on prior committed evidence.
  Project Admin implementation code exists, but Task 6 browser evidence remains open / BLOCKED_BROWSER_UNAVAILABLE.
  Build browser evidence is not Project Admin Task 6 evidence.

Next slice recommendation:
  Recommended next planning slice: ACC #11 2D sheet viewer first slice design.
  Pre-decision before implementation:
    local-only viewer shell/static sheet render
    vs real viewer-engine evaluation/adoption.
  Real 2D viewer engine work touches HUMAN_GATE.md.
  Equipment entity ID / ontology binding should be reserved as a viewer data slot first; real TypeDB, DB/API, or schema integration remains separate gated work.
  ACC #8 Build home dashboard is lower risk but less central than the current sheet-list-to-viewer workflow.

Verification:
  git status --short --untracked-files=all
    OBSERVED after cleanup edits:
      M EVIDENCE.md
      M PLAN.md
      M README.md
      M SPEC.md
      M docs/Task_List.md
      M docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md

  git diff --check
    PASS; no output.

  git diff --name-only -- src package.json package-lock.json reference docs/evidence
    PASS; no output.

  rg stale handoff terms in live handoff docs:
    PASS; no stale "Changes are not committed", "not committed", "commit split", "Commit-ready review rerun", or "Files to review before commit" matches.

  git diff --name-only
    OBSERVED:
      EVIDENCE.md
      PLAN.md
      README.md
      SPEC.md
      docs/Task_List.md
      docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md

Not rerun:
  npm test
  npm run build
  Browser validation

Reason:
  This cleanup edited documentation only.
  The required proof for this pass was no source/package/reference/evidence-asset diff plus whitespace and stale-handoff checks.

Remaining risk:
  The working tree is intentionally dirty with post-commit documentation cleanup.
  Project Admin Task 6 remains blocked until a changed page-level browser automation precondition is proven.
  The next viewer slice still needs document-loop setup and the local-only vs real-engine pre-decision.
```

## ACC #11 2D Sheet Viewer Document Loop Kickoff - 2026-06-18

```text
Date: 2026-06-18
Agent: Codex
Mode:
  ai-loop-orchestrator direct-subagent review plus main-session integration.

Scope:
  Start the ACC #11 `2D sheet viewer` first slice document-loop.
  No product implementation.
  No source, package, reference, docs/evidence, or .ai-loop runtime edits.
  No Project Admin Task 6 browser validation rerun.
  No 0009 request created.

Preflight snapshot:
  git status --short --untracked-files=all
    PASS; no output.

Prompt expected state vs live state:
  Branch:
    master
  Latest commit:
    f59d850 docs: refresh post-commit handoff cleanup
  Working tree:
    clean at preflight.
  Result:
    Expected state matched live state before document edits.

Coordination mode:
  direct-subagent, read-only assignments, with main-session document integration.

Subagent assignments:
  Assignment A - current handoff / Task 6 blocker guard:
    Result: PASS with caveat.
    Finding: Project Admin Task 6 remains BLOCKED_BROWSER_UNAVAILABLE after 0007/0008.
    Finding: Build browser evidence is not reused as Project Admin Task 6 evidence.
    Finding: ACC #11 document-loop can start while Task 6 remains open.
    Caveat: during this session, new ACC #11 kickoff docs appeared as expected current-session edits.

  Assignment B - ACC #11 2D sheet viewer reference/docs basis:
    Result: PASS.
    Finding: ACC #11 is the natural continuation from ACC #10 sheets list.
    Recommended requirement prefix: FR-SV, with T-SV, AC-SV, TS-SV, and UF-SV mappings.
    Recommended first slice: local-only viewer shell/static sheet render.

  Assignment C - viewer slice pre-decisions:
    Result:
      local-only static viewer shell: PASS for planning, not implementation.
      real viewer engine evaluation/adoption: HUMAN_GATE_REQUIRED.
      equipment entity ID / ontology data slot: PASS as reserved local data slot.
      expanded HUMAN_GATE scope: HUMAN_GATE_REQUIRED.

    local-only viewer shell/static sheet render.
  Real viewer engine:
    not authorized; HUMAN_GATE_REQUIRED.
  Equipment entity / ontology binding:
    reserve local viewer data slot only.
  TypeDB/DB/API/schema integration:
    not authorized; separate gated work.

Product check status vs evidence-path status:
  Build shell + Sheets list remains PASS based on prior committed evidence.
  Project Admin Task 6 remains open / BLOCKED_BROWSER_UNAVAILABLE.
  ACC #11 is document-loop kickoff only; no implementation evidence exists.
  Build browser evidence was not reused as Project Admin Task 6 evidence.

Progress-doc consistency:
  PLAN.md records Phase 4 document-loop kickoff and planning gate PENDING.
  docs/Task_List.md records T-SV-* as Planned / Gate Pending.
  docs/Planning_Gate_Checklist.md records kickoff readiness, not formal PASS.
  docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md points the next session to planning gate before implementation.

Verification run during kickoff:
  rg -n "FR-SV-00[1-9]" docs SPEC.md PLAN.md CHECKS.md HUMAN_GATE.md EVIDENCE.md
    PASS; FR-SV-001 through FR-SV-009 are represented in the current document set.

  rg -n "T-SV-00[1-9]|AC-SV-00[1-9]|TS-SV-00[1-9]|UF-SV-00[1-9]" docs PLAN.md CHECKS.md
    PASS; task, acceptance, test, and user-flow mappings are present.

  rg scope-boundary terms for real viewer engine, customer drawing, TypeDB, Autodesk, paid SDK, CAD editor, BLOCKED_BROWSER_UNAVAILABLE, and 0009
    PASS; matches are explicit exclusions, gates, or carry-forward blocker guards.

  git diff --name-only -- src package.json package-lock.json reference docs/evidence .ai-loop
    PASS; no output.

Not run:
  npm test
  npm run build
  Browser validation

Reason:
  This session edited planning/handoff documents only and did not touch src/package/reference/docs/evidence/.ai-loop runtime paths.

Human approval items:
  No human-gated work was performed.
  Real viewer engine evaluation/adoption, customer drawings, Autodesk-backed processing, paid SDK, DB/API/TypeDB/schema integration, CAD editor behavior, and deployment remain unapproved.

Next action:
  Run planning gate for the ACC #11 local-only viewer shell/static sheet render slice.
  Do not implement until planning gate PASS or explicitly accepted SLICE-ONLY PASS.
  Keep Project Admin Task 6 open until a changed browser automation precondition is documented and fresh Project Admin browser evidence is captured.

  git status --short --untracked-files=all -- src package.json package-lock.json reference docs/evidence evidence .ai-loop
    PASS; no output.
  git diff --check
    PASS; no output.

Planning-gate result:
  PASS.
  Missing files: none for the seven core docs or UI support docs.
  Temporary-slice status: not used; this is a full document-loop gate for the local-only viewer shell/static sheet render slice.
  Documents used as replacements: none.
  Feature-to-task gaps: none found for FR-SV-001 through FR-SV-009.
  Feature-to-acceptance gaps: none found for FR-SV-001 through FR-SV-009.
  Feature-to-test gaps: none found for FR-SV-001 through FR-SV-009.
  UI/user-flow gaps: none found for visible viewer shell actions.
  UI/spec gaps:
    One traceability gap was found and fixed before final PASS: docs/UI_Spec.md described the integration boundary but did not explicitly tag FR-SV-009.
    Added an Integration boundary viewer-state line for FR-SV-009.
    Remaining gaps: none.
  Data model gaps: none found for local viewer state, selected sheet context, local affordance state, and ontology-slot reservation.
  Ambiguous completion criteria: none found; AC-SV and TS-SV entries are pass/fail and boundary-aware.

Checklist truth and gate-label consistency:
  docs/Planning_Gate_Checklist.md now distinguishes document-loop kickoff readiness from formal planning-gate PASS.
  The checked SV kickoff/traceability items are backed by live document content reviewed in this session.
  docs/Task_List.md keeps T-SV-001 through T-SV-009 as Planned / Gate Pending, not implementation done.
  docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-2d-sheet-viewer-first-slice.md marks only the formal gate run and Task 6 separation as complete; implementation planning remains unchecked.
  No implementation PASS or browser-evidence PASS was claimed for ACC #11.

FR/T/AC/TS/UF-SV traceability result:
  FR-SV-001 through FR-SV-009 are present in PRD and mapped in TRD, UI_Spec, Data_Model, Task_List, Acceptance_Criteria, Test_Scenarios, Design_Map, and User_Flow.
  T-SV-001 through T-SV-009 map one-to-one to FR-SV-001 through FR-SV-009 and reference matching AC-SV and TS-SV IDs.
  AC-SV-001 through AC-SV-009 map one-to-one to FR-SV-001 through FR-SV-009.
  TS-SV-001 through TS-SV-009 map one-to-one to FR-SV-001 through FR-SV-009 and AC-SV-001 through AC-SV-009.
  UF-SV-001 through UF-SV-007 cover the actual viewer shell flow; FR-SV-008 and FR-SV-009 are correctly represented as local data-slot and out-of-scope boundary flow coverage.

HUMAN_GATE result:
  No human-gated work was performed.
  Real viewer engine evaluation/adoption, customer drawings, Autodesk-backed processing, paid SDK, DB/API/TypeDB/schema integration, CAD editor behavior, deployment, auth/RBAC, and external persistence remain unapproved.
  The planning gate only authorizes the local-only viewer shell/static sheet render slice to move toward a scoped implementation request.

Product check status vs evidence-path status:
  Build shell + Sheets list remains PASS based on prior committed evidence.
  ACC #11 has planning-gate PASS only; no product implementation or browser evidence exists yet.
  Project Admin Task 6 remains evidence-path blocked and separate from ACC #11.

Project Admin Task 6 status:
  Still open / BLOCKED_BROWSER_UNAVAILABLE.
  No 0009 request was created.
  Task 6 browser validation was not rerun.
  Build browser evidence was not reused as Project Admin Task 6 evidence.

Implementation eligibility:
  Authorized only for the ACC #11 local-only viewer shell/static sheet render slice after a scoped implementation request with owned files and TDD checks.
  Not authorized for real viewer engine, dependencies, customer drawings, TypeDB/DB/API/schema, Autodesk API, paid SDK, CAD editor behavior, deployment, or Task 6 evidence reuse.

Post-update verification:
  git status --short --untracked-files=all
    OBSERVED; dirty tree remains limited to ACC #11 document-loop docs and handoff docs listed in the preflight grouping.
  git diff --check
    PASS; no output.
  git diff --name-only -- src package.json package-lock.json reference docs/ evidence .ai-loop
    OBSERVED docs output because the broad pathspec includes allowed dirty docs.
  git diff --name-only -- src package.json package-lock.json reference docs/evidence evidence .ai-loop
    PASS; no output.
  FR-SV coverage script for PRD, TRD, UI_Spec, Data_Model, Task_List, Acceptance_Criteria, Test_Scenarios, Design_Map, and User_Flow
    PASS; all listed documents contain FR-SV-001 through FR-SV-009 after the UI_Spec boundary tag fix.
  T-SV / AC-SV / TS-SV coverage script
    PASS; T-SV-001 through T-SV-009, AC-SV-001 through AC-SV-009, and TS-SV-001 through TS-SV-009 are present in their owning documents.
  UF-SV coverage script
    PASS; UF-SV-001 through UF-SV-007 are present and FR-SV-008/009 are covered as data-slot and out-of-scope boundary rows.
  stale current-handoff gate-label search
    PASS; no current PLAN.md, docs/Planning_Gate_Checklist.md, viewer plan, or NEXT_SESSION.md match for stale PENDING formal gate wording.
  .ai-loop 0009 search and control inbox listing
    PASS; no output.

Not run:
  npm test
  npm run build
  Browser validation

Reason:
  This was a document-only planning-gate review and did not touch source, package, reference, docs/evidence, or .ai-loop runtime paths.

Skill operation notes:
  Worked well:
    The Checklist Truth And Gate Labels rule prevented treating kickoff readiness as formal PASS until this review verified live documents.
    Product checks, evidence-path blocker status, and progress-document status stayed separate.
  Needs attention:
    The broad forbidden-path command that includes `docs/` conflicts with the expected ACC #11 dirty docs; use a separate disallowed-path check for source/package/reference/docs/evidence/.ai-loop.
  Promotion candidate:
    Clarify in future requests whether `docs/` means all docs or only forbidden docs/evidence paths when the expected dirty state is document-only.

Reason:
  This request created documentation and a future implementation request only.
  No source, package, reference, docs/evidence, evidence, or .ai-loop runtime paths changed.

Project Admin Task 6 status:
  Still open / BLOCKED_BROWSER_UNAVAILABLE.
  No 0009 request was created.
  Task 6 browser validation was not rerun.
  Build or viewer browser evidence must not be reused as Task 6 evidence.

Human approval items:
  No human-gated work was performed.
  Real viewer engine evaluation/adoption, customer drawings, Autodesk-backed processing, paid SDK, DB/API/TypeDB/schema integration, auth/RBAC, CAD editor behavior, and deployment remain unapproved.

Skill operation notes:
  Worked well:
    Pathspec Scope Checks kept broad docs inventory separate from forbidden-path scope checks.
    The request keeps product checks, evidence-path blocker state, and implementation eligibility as separate axes.
  Needs attention:
    Future requests should avoid asking for broad `docs/` output to be empty while also allowing docs edits.
  Promotion candidate:
    Add a reusable request wording rule: when docs are allowed, call the broad `docs/` command an inventory command and use exact blocked subpaths such as `docs/evidence` for the scope verdict.

## DWG/DXF Upload Conversion Management Documentation - 2026-06-18

```text
Date: 2026-06-18
Agent: Codex
Scope:
  User requested documentation and session closeout for the next real drawing-upload direction.
  No product implementation.
  No source/package/reference/evidence-asset/.ai-loop runtime edits.

Current stage:
  DUC document scaffold complete.
  Formal DUC planning gate still required before implementation.
  ACC #11 local-only viewer shell/static render remains a separate implementation-ready slice.

Coordination:
  Direct subagents were used earlier in this session for DWG/DXF inventory, document boundary review, and git/worktree safety.
  Main session verified status and committed prior ACC #11 docs before this DUC documentation pass.

Pre-DUC clean baseline:
  git status --short --untracked-files=all
    PASS; no output after commit a927459.

Prior commit completed in this session:
  a927459 docs: record acc viewer planning handoff

Render attempt:
  A DXF to PNG preview attempt was started for COMM-ET01 using ezdxf PyMuPDF backend.
  The user interrupted because it appeared stalled.
  A running Python process was found and stopped:
    ProcessName: python
    StartTime: 2026-06-18 오후 4:16:03
  Result:
    Render quality/performance remains NOT PROVEN.
    Conversion and metadata scan are separate from viewer rendering success.

  Findings:
    APS Simple Viewer explicitly frames upload, translate, and preview for 3D designs and 2D drawings.
    The tutorial architecture uses Authentication, Data Management, Model Derivative, and Viewer.
    Data Management/OSS creates buckets, uploads objects, lists objects, and returns URNs.
    Model Derivative starts translation to SVF2 with 2D/3D views and checks manifest/status.
    Viewer SDK is a JavaScript browser viewer for 2D/3D design models with customization/extensions.
    Chrome DevTools/Network can help debug BIM360/Forma Viewer token/model-loading flows, but tokens/session data must not be committed.

JSON/progress artifact check:
  Existing project docs are Markdown-first with stable ID traceability.
  No production JSON documentation contract exists yet.
  DUC docs now propose a future JSON traceability/progress artifact for loop automation.

  DUC document scaffold is complete.
  Formal DUC planning gate is required next session before any DUC implementation.
  ACC #11 local-only viewer shell/static render remains separately implementation-ready.
  Project Admin Task 6 remains BLOCKED_BROWSER_UNAVAILABLE.

    Appended: ### 16:45 | 세션 14

Not run:
  Browser validation.
  Reason: no product UI implementation changed in this DUC documentation pass.

Human approval items:
  APS credentials/API calls, paid usage, ODA product dependency adoption, customer drawings, production file storage, DB/API/schema, TypeDB ingestion, auth/RBAC, token capture, and deployment remain gated.

Next session entry:
  Start from docs/sessions/NEXT_SESSION.md.
  First command: git status --short --untracked-files=all.
  Then run the formal DUC planning gate and choose one implementation path:
    Option A: ACC #11 local viewer shell first.
    Option B: DUC local conversion-lab management UI first.
    Option C: DUC script adapter / JSON scan output first.
```
