# Human Approval Gate

Stop and ask before:

- Changing authentication or permission models
- Creating or changing database schema
- Deleting project data or reference data
- Introducing customer or confidential drawing files beyond copied local references
- Connecting to Autodesk cloud accounts or external APIs
- Adding paid SDKs such as ODA or Autodesk services
- Deploying outside the local development machine
- Replacing the current scope of "viewer + overlay" with a CAD editor scope
- Introducing real Project Admin auth/RBAC enforcement
- Creating Project Admin DB schema or API persistence
- Sending email invites or provisioning user accounts
- Adding company management or company data to the Project Admin member-access slice
- Deleting or revoking project access records
- Opening, uploading, publishing, storing, or syncing real customer drawing files
- Adding a real 2D viewer engine, sheet version compare, or Autodesk-backed sheet processing
- Adopting ODA File Converter, LibreDWG, APS Model Derivative, APS Viewer, or any other DWG/DXF conversion/viewer engine as a product dependency
- Storing converted DXF/SVF/SVF2/thumbnail/metadata artifacts in a production or customer-facing repository, bucket, database, or service
- Capturing, reusing, storing, or committing Autodesk/ACC/BIM360 browser access tokens from Chrome DevTools or network logs
- Connecting viewer state to real TypeDB without a defined integration design and owned-file scope
- Designing the TypeDB ontology schema for drawing entities without a separate design gate
- Deploying any component beyond the local development machine

Decisions already accepted:

- Project folder name: `xd-drawing-system`
- Product family direction: XD system integration
- UI/UX source: saved ACC Build screenshots and local analysis documents
- Initial work: project setup and reference material copy only
- Initial setup slice implementation may use local mock data and local-only app scaffold.
- Project Admin member-access slice may use local mock `Project`, `Member`, and `ProjectMemberAccess` data only.
- Company information is excluded from the Project Admin member-access slice.
- Build shell and sheets list slice may use local mock `Sheet` metadata only.
- 2D viewer, upload/publish, sheet compare, file storage, Autodesk API, DB/API persistence, auth/RBAC, customer drawing data, and deployment are excluded from the Build shell and sheets list slice.
- ACC #11 first-slice document loop may assume a local-only viewer shell/static sheet render.
- Real viewer engine evaluation/adoption remains unapproved.
- Equipment entity ID / ontology binding may be reserved as a nullable local viewer data slot only.
- TypeDB deployment strategy: TypeDB is deployed separately on the engineer's PC. All drawings on the engineer's PC are analyzed and ingested into this local TypeDB instance. This is the confirmed XD system direction. Frontend integration design and wiring remain separate gated work — do not connect viewer state to TypeDB without a defined integration slice and human approval.
- DWG/DXF Upload Conversion Management may be documented as a separate planning slice using read-only reference DWG evidence and repo-outside temporary conversion output.
- A local technical experiment may use an already-installed ODA File Converter and installed Python packages as evidence only. Product dependency adoption, redistribution, license policy, customer file processing, or production storage remains unapproved.
